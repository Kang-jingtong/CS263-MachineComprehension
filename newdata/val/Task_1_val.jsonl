An MoD spokeswoman said two bags of explosives were found and had been moved into a field.  It is not clear which force inadvertently made the mistake.

It took hours for the city's police and fire services to rescue the woman in a high-wire operation authorities called \"technical and complex\". Why she climbed the nearly 12-storey high structure remains a mystery. After what Toronto Fire Services District Chief Stephan Powell called \"heavy deliberations\" by various emergency service teams over how to rescue the woman, a high-angle specialist climber was brought in to rappel up the crane around 6am. Toronto firefighter Rob Wonfor had to slowly climb up the inside the crane and reach the woman, who had lowered herself on a block hanging from the structure. The precarious rescue was \"not a speed sport\", Powell said. \"Every step has to be thought out.\" An Emergency Task Force officer, specialised in high-risk situations, was also sent up the crane to speak to the woman and keep her calm. Once Mr Wonfor reached her, he placed her in a harness and secured her to a safety line.  Both were then lowered to the ground by about 8:30am. Spectators who had gathered to watch the morning rescue applauded. Toronto Fire Chief Matthew Pegg called it a highly technical operation. \"There isn't a text book on that but I think we just wrote it,\" he said. Mr Wonfor told journalists after the more than two-hour long rescue that his first thought was: \"How did she get up there\"? He said the woman, who climbed the structure with no equipment, was calm during the whole event. \"She has to tell me how she did it because she's going to be our new training officer for high-angle rescues, because it's impressive,\" he said.

{"article": "The Wisconsin man's murder conviction was overturned this summer, however, prosecutors are appealing. The 27-year-old, who has learning difficulties, and his uncle Steven Avery were convicted of murdering a young woman, Teresa Halbach, in 2005. Avery and Dassey, who was 16 at the time, were sentenced to life in prison. Judge William Duffin ordered that Dassey be freed from prison under supervision until the next steps in the case become clear, reports the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Under his release conditions, he must submit to the probation and parole office by midday on Tuesday the address where he plans to reside. Dassey also must not have any contact with Ms Halbach's family, or co-defendant Avery, whose legal team hopes DNA evidence will clear him. Dassey's lawyer, Steve Drizin, told the Associated Press he hoped he would be free in time to spend Thanksgiving with his family on 24 November. \"That's what I'm focused on right now, getting him home, getting him with his family and then helping him to re-integrate back into society while his appeal plays out,\" Mr Drizin said. The same judge quashed Dassey's conviction in August, ruling that investigators had made false promises by assuring him \"he had nothing to worry about\". He confessed to helping Avery rape, kill and mutilate Ms Halbach. Wisconsin's attorney general had asked that Dassey not be released pending the appeal. The case received wide attention after the release of the 10-part documentary Making a Murderer in December 2015. The filmmakers cast doubt on the legal process used to convict Dassey and Avery. Avery was accused and found guilty of murdering Ms Halbach, a photographer for Auto Trader Magazine. Her charred remains were found at Avery's car salvage yard a week after she went there to photograph a minivan for sale. The documentary series focused on the conduct of law officials in Manitowoc County, Wisconsin.

More than 19,000 people in the UK get payments from the ILF. The government says councils, which administer most social care, will take over funding this help. The claimants fear disabled people could be forced out of independent living arrangements and into residential care, or trapped at home by the fund's closure. Questioning the legality of the consultation and subsequent decision by the government, the court challenge will argue: The Department for Work and Pensions says help for disabled people has been fundamentally changed by personal budgets, intended to give recipients more control, and that it makes sense to have a single system administered by local authorities. The ILF was established in 1988, but the government decided in 2010 that it had become \"no longer appropriate or sustainable\" to keep running the scheme outside the mainstream social care system. The fund closed to new applicants soon afterwards. Richard Hawkes, chief executive of disability charity Scope, said councils could not afford to \"pick up the tab\". \"Local care and support for disabled people is already underfunded to the tune of £1.2bn and councils are already struggling to cope. \"Not getting the support to wash, dress and leave your home is unacceptable.

{"article": "Making his debut against Tony Blair in December 2005, David Cameron's famous line was when he said of the prime minister: \"He was the future once.\" Indeed, Mr Cameron went full circle with this, joking at his last ever appearance at Prime Minister's Questions, before handing over to Theresa May, \"I was the future once\". Gordon Brown had waited many years to take his bow at Prime Minister's Questions - and the occasion came on 4 July 2007. Taking place days after attempted suicide bombings in London and Glasgow, the Commons clash with David Cameron was dominated by security issues. Mr Brown sought to strike a consensual note by saying all parties should \"show unity in the face of terror\" but the two leaders clashed over the need for identity cards and the banning of extremist groups. The prime minister announced a number of security-related initiatives but was jeered by the opposition when, in response to one question, he said he had \"only been in the job for five days\". Tony Blair has spoken of the nerves he felt as prime minister ahead of the weekly session but when he was leader of the opposition, he often made it look like plain sailing. Facing John Major for the first time, on 18 October 1994, he attacked what he said were serious divisions at the top of the government over Europe, particularly over the single currency and whether a referendum would be needed before joining the euro. A \"divided government was a weak government\", he told MPs. John Major faced PM's questions on his second day as prime minister on 29 November 1990, having never done it before. The session got off to a humorous start, when Labour MP Dennis Skinner shouted \"resign\" as Mr Major rose to answer his first question. Opposition leader Neil Kinnock then offered the new prime minister his \"personal congratulations\" on his election as leader. The future of the poll tax dominated exchanges. Mr Kinnock said it would save a lot of \"time and money\" to just abolish it. Mr Major steered a middle course, saying a thorough review of the controversial tax was the right action to take. Pundits eagerly awaited the new Labour leader's PMQs debut in September 2015 - his first ever outing at the despatch box, having spent the previous decades watching from the backbenches. In a departure from the usual format for the Commons clash, he opted to ask the prime minister a series of questions sent to him by members of the public - on housing, mental health, public services. Mr Corbyn said he wanted \"less theatre and more facts\" at the weekly parliamentary session. Ed Miliband gave David Cameron \"nought out of two\" in answering his questions as the pair had their first squabble at PMQs about benefits, which came after a quieter first exchange about the death of Linda Norgrove, the aid worker killed in Afghanistan. He said he wanted to \"change the tone\" of PMQs exchanges, as he demanded \"straight answers to straight questions\", in the session in October 2010. The pair also dug into the archives to remind each other and the House about previous pledges by their opponents. The new Tory leader was always regarded as a tough debater but how would he fare in the bearpit of PMQs? Taking on Tony Blair, on 12 November 2003, he accused the prime minister of running an incompetent and wasteful government and derided the PM's answers, saying at one point: \"Two questions asked, neither answered: not a very good start I'm afraid.\" Although the atmosphere was electric, the clash was largely nostalgic in flavour. After his surprise victory in the Tory leadership contest, Iain Duncan Smith's debut outing on 17 October 2001, was eagerly awaited, although it took place in a sombre atmosphere, just weeks after the 9/11 attacks. He opted to spread his six questions into two segments: the first on Afghanistan, where he backed the UK-supported military action against the Taliban, and the second on Labour's proposed NHS reforms, which was far more heated. He raised the case of a constituent who had died after spending nine hours on a hospital trolley, and said Labour's \"promises of a better tomorrow\" would sound \"hollow\" to their family and many others. Mr Blair said such failings were \"unacceptable\" but hit out at the Tories for not supporting their investment in the NHS. A youthful William Hague faced an exceedingly tough task, taking on the leadership of a party which had just been battered at the polls and lost many of its big names. At his first PMQs - now being held once a week - against Tony Blair on 25 June 1997, he seized on reports that a Labour MP had been threatened with expulsion from the party for campaigning against proposals for a Welsh Assembly. He said it showed the \"arrogant behaviour\" of a government which could not tolerate \"honest and open\" debate.

An initial investigation suggested Capt Gelman was fatally wounded as a result of the fire, it added. The assailant was also shot and sustained moderate injuries. Gush Etzion, a bloc of Jewish settlements located between Jerusalem and Hebron, has been one of the focal points of a five-month surge in violence between Israelis and Palestinians. Wednesday's incident began when a soldier stationed at Gush Etzion Junction saw a Palestinian armed with a knife charging at Capt Gelman, an Israeli military spokesperson told the Jerusalem Post. The soldier fired at the assailant, striking both him and the captain, according to an initial investigation, the spokesperson added. Capt Gelman was taken to the Shaare Zedek Medical Centre in Jerusalem in a critical condition, but he succumbed to his wounds two hours after the attack. At least 27 Israelis have been killed in a wave of stabbing, shooting or car-ramming attacks by Palestinians or Israeli Arabs since October. More than 160 Palestinians - mostly attackers, Israel says - have also been killed in that period. The assailants who have been killed have either been shot dead by their victims or security forces as they carried out attacks. Some attackers have been arrested. Other Palestinians have been killed in clashes with Israeli troops.

The detainees said they were shouted at and spat on, deprived of sleep and given little, substandard food. \"The combination of conditions both in and outside the interrogation room constitutes abuse and inhuman, degrading treatment, at times even amounting to torture,\" the report said.

But it falls at the first hurdle due to Theresa May's apparent lack of understanding of devolution. Health and education are run by the Welsh Government in Wales, so was the prime minister proposing to \"take back control\" of those fields from Westminster? The Welsh Conservatives were unable to shed much light on the policy so I contacted Conservative Campaign Headquarters, who issued the prime minister's comments. And the answer, as is often the case in politics, is more cock-up than conspiracy. There was, I was told, a mistake in that sentence. A sentence, it's just possible, the prime minister has never seen, but one might expect a party to ensure its press releases in devolved areas are checked for that sort of inaccuracy. Mrs May is not the only senior politician to make the error of suggesting devolution starts and stops with Scotland and Northern Ireland. (It's a mistake broadcasters make too). Jeremy Corbyn told his 2016 party conference that: \"We will introduce an arts pupil premium to every primary school in England and Wales and consult on the design and national roll-out to extend this pupil premium to all secondary schools.\" The Liberal Democrats pointed out that the education secretary in Wales is a Lib Dem. And Welsh Labour politely corrected Mr Corbyn, who presumably won't make the same mistake again.

{"article": "The second reading of the Housing Bill, applying only to England and Wales, is due to take place on 2 November. Right-to-buy is being outlawed in Scotland and is not an issue the SNP would normally have voted on. English MPs were given a veto over Commons legislation that affects England only on Thursday. The SNP is furious about the move, which it says will make its MPs \"second class\" citizens. They have promised to act responsibly when deciding when to challenge the application of the new rules - but sources say they will create \"mischief\" when the opportunity arises. The Housing Bill could provide their first opportunity - particularly if it is found to contain financial implications for Scotland. The party is also demanding to know whether Scottish MPs will be prevented from voting on the future expansion of airport capacity in the South East of England amid suggestions from some Conservatives that it could be an English-only matter. \"Expansion of airport capacity impacts on connectivity for the whole of the UK and, therefore, any vote must be an issue on which all MPs have a say,\" said the party's transport spokesman Drew Hendry. \"The expansion of airport capacity has constantly been promoted by the UK government as a national infrastructure project - it will have massive impact on travel, exports, growth and jobs across the four nations of these islands - not just London and the South East of England.\" The new process of legislative scrutiny, with a stage for England will not apply to bills which have already had their second reading in the House of Commons. As well as right-to-buy, the Housing Bill also introduces the requirement for local authorities in England to dispose of vacant high value council properties to fund right to buy extension and to build more affordable homes. There will now be a new stage added to the usual law-making process at Westminster allowing MPs for English constituencies to vote on issues deemed to only affect England. These MPs would be able to veto the legislation before all MPs from across the United Kingdom voted in the bill's final readings. Speaker John Bercow will decide whether a Bill only affects England, and all MPs in the Commons will still have to pass legislation at other stages of the process.

Succession fears have fuelled tensions on the Korean peninsula. The current stand-off follows the North's shelling of a South Korean island in November. On Friday, North Korea called for parliamentary talks on how \"to settle the grave situation prevailing between the North and the South.\" This request was rejected by Seoul as it \"lacked sincerity\", the unification ministry said. However, the two Koreas have agreed to bilateral military talks on the fatal attack on Yeongpeong island and the sinking in March of a South Korean warship, widely blamed on a North Korean torpedo attack - although the North strongly denies any role. Seoul has also proposed separate talks on Pyongyang's renewed pledges on its nuclear disarmament. Kim Jong-il's eldest son was interviewed in mid-January by the Tokyo Shimbun. Hereditary succession \"does not fit with socialism, and my father was against it as well,\" he was quoted as saying in the article, which was published on Friday. \"My understanding is that (succession) was to stabilise the internal system. An unstable North Korea leads to instability in the region.\" He said he wanted his youngest half-brother to \"take over the great works my father has done. I want him to enrich people's lives,\" he said. He said: \"North Korea should pay attention to reform and openness. If it continues like this, it cannot become an economic power.

{"article": "\"I thought I knew a fair amount about American history,\" says John Ridley, \"yet only a few years ago I hadn't even heard of Solomon Northup.\" Ridley is a highly successful 48-year-old African-American writer, whose credits range from The Fresh Prince of Bel Air to the Iraq war satire Three Kings. He's also the Bafta-nominated screenwriter of 12 Years a Slave. \"The fact that a well-educated guy like me didn't know Solomon's story says a lot about how ignorant America can be of parts of its past. I'm delighted to help return him to our nation's culture.\" The book Twelve Years a Slave was published in 1853 by the American firm of Derby and Miller. It had been written very quickly, emerging only months after Solomon Northup escaped from a Louisiana plantation. Published in London at the same time, the book sold well at first - but by the end of the century was little read. Ridley says the movie came about in part because he and director Steve McQueen share an agent. \"Steve and I sat down to talk one day and we quickly realised we were both keen to explore slavery as an idea. But it was Steve's wife Bianca (cultural critic Bianca Stigter) who gave him Solomon's book - otherwise I doubt we would have come across it. \"Steve loved the book and passed it to me. I thought it was a singular and evocative document. It's not long but I was overwhelmed by its scope and scale.\" The narrative is straightforward: in 1841, Solomon Northup is living a settled and fairly prosperous life in Saratoga, near New York. He is a free man but is tricked into going to Washington DC, where he is drugged, kidnapped and sent south as a slave. Twelve years later, he gets word out to friends and is rescued. Perhaps the real interest is the detail of slave life - both the harsh cruelty and the periods of domesticity. Relations with the owners who purchase Solomon along the way are crucial, especially with Edwin Epps (played in the film by Michael Fassbender). The middle of the 19th Century saw the publication of many slave narratives in America, designed mainly to support the cause of abolition. The best-known (though much criticised since) was Uncle Tom's Cabin, which appeared in 1852. That Twelve Years a Slave didn't slip into total obscurity was partly the work of Louisiana historian Sue Eakin. She died three years ago, aged 90, but her daughter Sara recalls years of helping with the research. \"When she was 11 or so, a neighbour gave Mom the book to read. She grew up near where Solomon had been a slave, so she was astonished and excited to find reference to plantations and even to families she knew well. \"Later, at college, Mom bought an old copy for 25 cents in Baton Rouge and the bookstore owner told her it was a worthless old potboiler and was probably all made up.  That annoyed her so much she set out to discover more about Solomon and his life. I guess in those days no-one else was interested in him at all. \"Then, in 1968, she co-edited a new edition of the book. It was no bestseller but it was the beginning of it coming back into some sort of circulation. By then, it was more than a century old but Mom felt Solomon had written a fair account of how life in central Louisiana must have been. She felt it should be better known - though she'd be surprised to see that Solomon's suddenly world-famous.\" There were always those who claimed Northup's tale was an exaggeration, or even a total fabrication written as anti-slavery propaganda. Sara is proud that her mother was one of the first to find detailed corroboration of his story. \"After he was freed, there is documentation of his attempt to secure legal redress against his kidnappers,\" she says. \"It was a bitter experience for him because in the nation's capital, Washington DC, Solomon's colour meant he wasn't allowed to testify. So the court case got nowhere but the paperwork is now a big help to historians.\" Professor Clifford Brown co-wrote a recent biography of Northup. He says that in the last 20 years, some of the detail of his life has become clearer. \"It's been a matter of looking carefully at census records and at maps of the time, or whatever. We have more detail now of how his father had been freed in 1798 and of the life Solomon and his wife Anne led in Saratoga before the kidnapping. \"The manifest of the ship which carried him to New Orleans exists in the US National Archives. That manifest contains names of people Solomon mentioned. There are also hospital records in New Orleans which feature his name. \"And, in January 1853, the New York Times had published a detailed account of Solomon's adventures which preceded the book and which tells the same basic story. So evidence of the book's accuracy is convincing.\" A question long debated is the contribution of David Wilson, credited in 1853 as the book's editor. Some have claimed Wilson in effect wrote Twelve Years a Slave. Professor Brown says it's clear the work was created by Solomon Northup relating his experiences to Wilson, who then knocked them into shape for publication. \"It's the equivalent today of a celebrity putting out a book 'as told to' a professional writer or journalist,\" he says. \"Perhaps there are parts of the book where the tone is slightly more Wilson than Northup but that doesn't invalidate the tale he's telling.\" Like Sue Eakin before him, Professor Brown has had to accept the fact that, a few years after his release in 1853, Solomon Northup simply disappears from the pages of history. \"It's a big frustration,\" he says. \"We have no real idea where he spent his final years or what he was doing or where he died. Perhaps there's a gravestone somewhere with his name on it and we just haven't found it yet.\" It has been suggested that after his escape from captivity, Solomon worked for the Underground Railroad which helped other slaves escape from the southern states, mainly to Canada, but as yet there is no conclusive evidence. Professor Brown concedes that, even now, aspects of Solomon's life remain hard to pin down. \"For instance, the engraving of Solomon in the book's first edition I believe probably is a likeness of him, though no one can be sure. And it's even possible a photograph existed - photography was just starting in the 1850s. It's something we're actively trying to track down.\" Perhaps if there were more visual evidence for Solomon's life, he wouldn't have disappeared into the shadows the way he did for most of the 20th Century. Screenwriter John Ridley laments that currently we can't write the last act of Solomon Northup's extraordinary life-story. \"He died invisibly and anonymously. That's kind of a sad irony: to disappear for 12 years, to be liberated and indeed become a bit of a celebrityâ€¦ And then just vanish again. \"Hopefully with all the new interest in him, someone will be able to discover exactly what did happen to Solomon.  That would be wonderful.\"", "question": "With 10 Bafta and seven Golden Globe nominations , 12 Years a Slave looks set to triumph this awards season .

Flip Out Chester said it had an excellent safety record and has replaced the attraction in question. Ms Jones is the latest in a number of people who said they have been injured at the activity centre, including a 29-year-old woman from Oswestry in Shropshire and a 21-year-old man from Ellesmere Port. It has prompted Cheshire West and Chester council to launch an investigation into the park. Ms Jones said she was injured after going on The Tower Jump attraction at the park. She told BBC Wales that she had jumped from a 12ft (3.7m) platform into a foam pit, as instructed in a safety briefing. \"As I landed I heard a crunch in my back. Instantly I had like a sharp shooting pain in my spine and it came all around my hips and down my legs. \"I couldn't stand up or anything - I lost all the strength in my legs.\" She said doctors later discovered a bone in her lower back had been seriously damaged and could have left her paralysed. \"I've been extremely lucky. It's just an unnecessary injury that shouldn't have happened in the first place,\" she added.

{"article": "The attack on the party was apparently co-ordinated by the DUP and Sinn Féin. Peter Robinson told MLAs he listened \"open-mouthed\" to a denial by SDLP deputy leader Dolores Kelly, claiming what she said was \"totally misleading\". Last week, Ms Kelly dismissed Sinn Féin's claim that the SDLP had agreed a position on welfare reform with the DUP, the UUP and Alliance in December. She was speaking on the BBC's The View programme. During first minister's questions in the assembly, Sinn Féin MLA Mickey Brady asked Mr Robinson whether the SDLP had been part of a four-party deal on 17 December that did not include a multi-million pound supplementary payment fund. Mr Robinson said this had been the case. He went on to criticise Ms Kelly: \"If the member were to do what she should do at the speed that she should do it, I would not like to be standing between her and the confessional. \"For anybody to suggest, as she did, that her party had not endorsed either the four-party agreement or the five-party agreement is totally misleading.\" However, other SDLP politicians have agreed with Ms Kelly's version of events. The SDLP and Sinn Féin have been trading fierce words over the welfare issue as the legislation on changes to benefits has been making its way through the assembly. On 19 December, the five executive parties signed off on the Stormont Castle Agreement, in which they agreed proposals to put to the British government. The British and Irish governments and the parties struck the Stormont House Agreement on 23 December, which dealt with a number of issues - including welfare reform, the budget and how to deal with the legacy of the Troubles. The Stormont Castle Agreement has been published, and reveals several differences between the parties' proposals and what ended up in the Stormont House Agreement. One is about the financial penalties which Stormont had to pay to the Treasury because it had not agreed to the welfare changes introduced in the rest of the UK. The parties wanted the penalties, which amounted to tens of millions of pounds, to be scrapped. But this was not in the final deal. The Stormont Castle Agreement also included a proposal to replace the Parades Commission with two new bodies - one to facilitate local dialogue and another to rule on contentious marches. This also did not make it into the Stormont House Agreement. Instead, the final deal featured an agreement in principle that parading should be devolved to Stormont and that proposals should be brought to the executive by June.", "question": "The first minister has criticised the SDLP for denying it signed up to a welfare reform @placeholder agreement .", "option_0": "special", "option_1": "provisional", "option_2": "deserved", "option_3": "major", "option_4": "fortified", "label": 1}

{"article": "Mencap and the Challenging Behaviour Foundation have spoken of the risks of moving patients hundreds of miles. The warning comes as the results of a serious case review into the abuse of patients at the private hospital near Bristol are due to be released. The abuse was uncovered during secret filming by the BBC Panorama programme. Eleven people have admitted charges of ill-treatment and neglect related to the abuse. South Gloucestershire Safeguarding Adults Board (SAB) commissioned the review, carried out by an independent expert. Mencap and the Challenging Behaviour said they had received 260 reports from families concerning abuse and neglect in institutional care since the Panorama programme was aired in May last year. Their joint report - Out of Sight - detailed a number of serious incidences reported by families, including physical assault, sexual abuse and the overuse of restraint. Mencap chief executive Mark Goldring said: \"We fear that unless the government commits to a strong action plan to close large institutions and develop appropriate local services for people with a learning disability, there is a very real risk that another Winterbourne View will come to light.\" There are currently hundreds of people with a learning disability in assessment and treatment units like Winterbourne View, the charities said. Many of these are located hundreds of miles from home, where people are at particular risk of neglect and abuse, they added. Vivien Cooper, founder of the Challenging Behaviour Foundation, said they had \"deep concerns\" over patient \"safety and welfare\". \"Many hundreds of people with a learning disability are being sent away to care institutions hundreds of miles from home, where they remain for years unnecessarily, at risk of neglect and abuse,\" she said. A Department of Health spokeswoman said: \"We are clear that wherever possible people should be supported to live in their own homes within their local community. \"In a small number of cases people might need access to good quality assessment and treatment services which might include some short periods of in-patient care. \"However this is not a substitute for high quality care within the community. \"It is vital all services are commissioned properly, reviewed regularly and not used as a long-term solution.\" Twenty-four patients were transferred from Castlebeck-run Winterbourne View, near Hambrook, following the BBC investigation.

{"article": "Mr Erdogan's win and victory speech led all television bulletins, with some pro-government and private channels - Kanal 24, TRT Haber and CNN Turk - using his campaign symbol of a large star surrounded by smaller ones as their presenter backdrop. CNN Turk devoted much of its main morning bulletin to Mr Erdogan's win, with special reports on preparations for his victory speech and celebrations in cities across Turkey. State-run TRT Haber replaced its morning bulletin with a studio discussion of the win. Opposition Halk TV broadcast a markedly more critical panel discussion in its main bulletin, with guests asking how Mr Erdogan could hope to be \"president of the whole nation\" after giving his victory address from the balcony of his party headquarters. All channels reported opposition candidates' reactions, although CNN Turk did not turn to them until 20 minutes into its main bulletin. Several channels registered a fall in support for the opposition since the March local elections, and reported main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) spokesman Haluk Koc blaming this on a poor turnout by opposition supporters. That point was also made by the nationalist newspaper Ortadogu, which said a third of voters stayed away to enjoy the August holiday. Almost all newspapers splash photos of Mr Erdogan either casting his vote or speaking from the balcony on their front pages, but the comment within is far more varied. Pro-government papers endorse the prime minister's ambition of increasing the powers of the presidency, with the more Islamist-inclined dailies adding a note of religious exultation. Sabah calls Mr Erdogan the \"man of the nation\", Star says he's the \"president of the nation\", and Aksam goes further in promoting a \"revolution for the nation\" and the \"birth of a new Turkey\" - the Erdogan campaign slogan. Haber Turk referred to his \"historic victory\", with Aksam recalling that his Justice and Development Party has won every election for the past 12 years. In the Islamist camp, Yeni Akit declares \"Ya Allah, Bismillah!\" - a religious invocation to begin an action - while the tabloid Takvim says Erdogan's win \"came from heaven\". The liberal Islamic Yeni Safak greets a \"New Turkey\" that could end the \"pause\" in Middle Eastern history caused by the abolition of the Ottoman Empire in 1923. Opposition and non-partisan papers are more sceptical of Mr Erdogan's chances of remaking Turkey, saying he lacks a convincing mandate. The firmly anti-Erdogan Cumhuriyet notes on its front page that he failed to win enough votes to change the powers of the presidency. It devotes considerable attention to the \"race\" for the premiership among Mr Erdogan's colleagues, although the similarly-inclined Sozcu thinks the new president will appoint a loyal follower and continue to run the government himself. Newspapers associated with Islamic thinker Fethullah Gulen, a former mentor and now exiled enemy of Mr Erdogan's, report the election win in fairly neutral terms, although Zaman puts an editorial on its front page saying the vote will change nothing unless the government \"abandons arrogance and oppression\". Some papers take a harsher line. Left-wing Birgun's headline says that nearly half of voters do not see Mr Erdogan as \"legitimate\", while the nationalist Aydinlik declares bluntly: \"We will take you down from there.\" Mr Erdogan's supporters on social media are jubilant, and the hashtags #ErdoganMakingHistory (erdogan tarih yaziyor ) and #NationsPrayersWithErdogan are the top Twitter trends. \"The old Turkey is left behind, today is the first day, we have woken up to a new Turkey,\" user Saglam Irade says, while writer Markar Esayan posts: \"New Turkey, peace, process and consistent foreign policy have won, but more importantly the Turkish public's will has won.\" Some of Mr Erdogan's critics turn on the voters. \"Our dear public has determined their future with their own votes and taken responsibility for their future. They have no right to complain now,\" tweets journalist Oktay Eksi. Others seek consolation in his narrow win. \"He won, but has his dream of changing the constitution shattered?\" asks columnist Ugur Gurses. Satirical website Zaytung posted a picture of two Erdogans sitting face to face, captioned \"Prime Minister Erdogan congratulates President Erdogan\", and hundreds have retweeted it to mock the new president's pre-eminence in politics.

Relatively few places are available to Scots through the clearing system which is designed to allocate \"spare\" places. Yet a week or so later, they may feel aggrieved to find places are available to applicants from other parts of the UK. The clearing system is a complex issue. It is far more subtle than a headline claiming a Scot is losing out to someone from England, Wales or Northern Ireland. It is the price of free tuition at Scottish university - a price the policy's supporters would say was worth paying. To put this in context though, the number of places at Scottish universities available to Scots is at an historic high. By this week the number of Scottish applicants accepted to Scottish institutions had reached 30,400 - 4% up on this time last year. However, this may be little consolation to those who have lost out on the course they actually wanted to do. Essentially there are now three groups of students at Scottish universities. This two tier system for Scottish and other UK students is the result of free tuition in Scotland. But universities strongly contend that comparing students in the different categories is like comparing apples with pears. They deny claims Scots are losing out to fee-paying students from elsewhere and say this shows a misunderstanding of the issue. Realistically the only way to end the distinction would be if tuition fees were re-introduced in Scotland or if free tuition was brought back in other parts of the UK. The former would mean Scottish universities would be free to take in as many Scots as they wanted.  The latter could end the distinction in the clearing system. Either would probably mean that there was no hard and fast distinction between Scottish applicants and prospective students from other parts of Britain.

Mr Holmes, a Computer Conservation Society volunteer, said it was a unique machine important for putting modern technology into context. He said he was negotiating with various organisations to find it a new home. \"It's a big beast.

Mr Abe said he had visited the World War Two memorial in Washington and reflected upon the 400,000 American troops who died with \"deep repentance in my heart\". \"My dear friends, on behalf of Japan and the Japanese people, I offer with profound respect my eternal condolences to the souls of all American people that were lost during World War Two,'' he said, to warm applause. Mr Abe also acknowledged that Japan had \"brought suffering to the peoples in Asian countries\", adding: \"We must not avert our eyes from that.\" However, correspondents say he stopped short of offering his own apology for Japan's conduct during the war, which included the sexual enslavement of tens of thousands of Asian women by Japanese troops. In the audience was Lee Yong-soo, one of thousands of Korean women forced into Japanese military brothels during the war. She was invited to Congress by Democratic Representative Mike Honda, a strong critic of Mr Abe. Mr Abe was the first Japanese Prime Minister to address a joint session of the US Congress. He also urged lawmakers to support the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), \"for the sake of our children and our children's children\" The TPP is aimed at liberalising markets in 12 countries and the US and Japan are among the biggest players. Mr Abe said the deal was about spreading shared values of rule of law, democracy and freedom. He added: \"It is also about our security. Long-term, its strategic value is awesome. We should never forget that. \"Let us bring the TPP to a successful conclusion through our joint leadership.\"", "question": "Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has expressed \" deep repentance \" over Japan 's role in World War Two , during an @placeholder address to the US Congress .", "option_0": "impressive", "option_1": "historic", "option_2": "earlier", "option_3": "independent", "option_4": "extreme", "label": 1}
{"article": "While the whole world has been focusing on the Panama Papers leak, we have been engulfed in our own local leaks here in Ghana. Not of the secret offshore accounts kind but of the examinations kind. We are in the midst of what seems to be a regular embarrassing crisis. This year, just like the year before, there are reports that the questions for the West African Senior School Certificate exams have leaked. The morning the exams were due to start, a national newspaper carried a front page story announcing that the questions for three subjects, Oral English, Integrated Science and Social Studies, had leaked and some students had received the questions on social media between the hours of midnight and 04:00. I have been wondering how helpful leaked questions for Oral English can be. Would I have fared any better if my A-level Oral French questions had been leaked to me at 01:00 on the morning of the exams? I suspect not. But times change, I have to concede. There have been photos of the thighs of students with words written on them, which were said to be answers to the questions they were facing in the exams. As can be expected there is the inevitable outcry from everybody, all the way to President John Mahama, who has expressed his indignation that the West African Examination Council was not able to protect the integrity of its exams. The head of its national office has offered the most reassuring explanation: What had happened should not be called a leak of the questions; it was a simply a case of the children getting \"foreknowledge\" of the questions. Apparently it only qualifies as a leak when students get access to questions a number of days before the exams. When it happens hours before, as in this case, then the students had \"foreknowledge\". I was not quite sure whether to laugh or to cry and as I have followed the ensuing discussions and arguments, I notice that most people were only worried that their certificates would be deemed worthless and degraded by institutions in the parts of the world Ghanaians aspire to go to - the UK, US, Australia, etc. It seems it is perfectly OK for us to have worthless and degraded certificates for our use here in Ghana. Then I discovered that this was not a problem plaguing us here in Ghana alone. A little search revealed that other countries on the continent, like Kenya, Zambia and Zimbabwe, and, of course, our West African neighbours regularly have similar problems. India has also had the most interesting stories about exam leakages and/or foreknowledge of questions. What I find the most shocking about the phenomenon in Ghana, though, is the regular involvement of teachers and parents in attempts to compromise the integrity of exams. Schoolchildren have told stories of parents giving them money to buy leaked questions. Teachers have been found to offer prepared answers to their students. I have decided there is no point in getting myself scandalised by these outrages. These days I pick my fights and if parents and teachers think it is acceptable to undermine the integrity of exams, I know I am up against it. It helps, though, that I now have an explanation for the 30-something-year-old I met recently who cannot read or write and claims to have completed Junior High School (JHS). Now, when I am confronted with mediocrity in public life, and when I am dismayed with the obvious illiteracy of people in high public positions who are supposed to have academic qualifications, I can safely explain the situation to myself. They must have had \"foreknowledge\" of questions in their exams at the basic, secondary, degree and maybe even masters and PhD levels.

However, a version released by Gloucestershire County Council contained an easy way to reveal the full unredacted details.

Details were removed by the council as they were deemed commercially sensitive. In the meantime, the faulty version that was mistakenly released on the council's website has been replaced. The incinerator project, at Javelin Park, met with fierce opposition and was only approved following a public inquiry.

The BBC is not able, for legal reasons, to say how to circumvent the redactions or reveal details of what they say. \"An earlier version of the waste contract published on the council website could be manipulated to expose the redactions,\" a spokesman said. \"This was replaced as soon as we were aware.

At one point it fell below 16,000 for the first time since February 2014, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq index was 1% lower, recovering from an earlier plunge of 8%.

Read the latest updates on our live page here. The floor was buzzing long before the US market open. All the traders knew this wouldn't be a typical sleepy August Monday. Minutes after the opening bell, the Dow fell a staggering 1089 points, its biggest ever points drop. One floor trader complained his shirt was soaked with sweat after the early plunge in stocks. Another, Stephen Guilfoyle from Deep Value, told me the US markets were 'bordering on the edge of panic but not quite there yet.' He can remember the crash of 1987 and said this didn't feel as bad. Indeed by late morning, US markets were showing some resilience, leading Mark Otto of J Streicher to conclude that Monday's big market moves in the US were similar to the 'flash crash' of 2010, when billions of dollars were wiped off some of the world's biggest companies in a matter of minutes, only to recover almost as quickly.

Duncan Weldon: China share falls - why it's not 2008 10th session in a row that the FTSE has fallen 8.5% fall in Chinese stocks - biggest one day loss since 2007 $42.51 Brent crude fell to lowest level since March, 2009 -2% At one point, the pound saw the biggest fall against the euro in six years China's central bank devalued the country's currency, the yuan, two weeks ago, raising fresh concerns that a slowdown in the country's economy was worse than originally feared. Currencies and commodities are also falling sharply, because those markets rely heavily on strong demand from China. Without strong reassurances from officials in China, investors have not had much reason to buy. Beijing's official mouthpiece has called it China's \"Black Monday\". The Shanghai Composite tumbled by 8.5%, its biggest fall since 2007. That plunge wiped out this year's gains as investors refused to buy into the Chinese government's repeated attempts to shore up confidence. Everyone wants to know what the Chinese government is going to do next to shore up shares and confidence in the economy. The smart money is on the central bank reducing interest rates and injecting a semblance of consumer confidence into the markets. That is what many had hoped would happen over the weekend. But at each point in what appears to be an ever-deepening Chinese slowdown, the government has seemed slow to react. Selling that started earlier this summer has gained momentum, experts say. \"It does appear that we're moving very quickly to the downside,\" said David Madden, market analyst at IG. Widespread investor fears about the sharp drops in Asia were exacerbated by thin trading volumes in Europe, with many investors away on holiday. \"I think more uncertainty lies ahead,\" Mr Madden said. Investors might have to wait for several weeks for bargain hunters to come into the market to lift stocks. Beijing's latest intervention, to allow its main state pension fund to invest in the stock market, failed to calm traders' fears, both in China and abroad. Over the past week, the Shanghai index fell 12%, adding up to a 30% drop since the middle of June. The sharp fall sparked a global sell-off, with the Dow Jones in the US losing 6%, while the FTSE 100 posted its biggest weekly loss this year, of 5%. Earlier this month, the Chinese central bank devalued the yuan in an attempt to boost exports. European investors worry that a cheaper Chinese currency will make European exports less competitive.

He was accused of insulting Islam by referring to a verse in the Koran during a campaign speech. Mr Purnama denied blasphemy and in court said he would mount an appeal. His remarks about Islam had sparked outrage among religious hardliners. They staged regular large rallies calling for him to face trial, with some extremists even calling for him to be executed. Ahead of the verdict, protesters for and against Mr Purnama had gathered outside the Supreme Court in Jakarta demanding respectively his acquittal or a long prison sentence. Around 15,000 security personnel from the police and military are providing security at the scene, with riot police and armoured vehicles separating the groups. Mr Purnama became Jakarta's first non-Muslim governor for 50 years when he took over from Joko \"Jokowi\" Widodo, who was elected president in 2014. It was significant because as an ethnic Chinese Indonesian and a Christian he is a double minority in Muslim-majority Indonesia. His political success was also seen as a significant development given the violent anti-Chinese riots that occurred in the city in 1998. Before the blasphemy allegations, he had been widely hailed as a straight-talking politician with a strong anti-corruption stance But the controversy overshadowed scheduled elections last month. Despite his enduring popularity with many in Jakarta for his efforts to improve living standards, he lost to conservative Muslim candidate Anies Rasyid Baswedan.

{"article": "The extensive bed of at least 100 million flame shells was found during a survey of Loch Alsh, a sea inlet between Skye and the Scottish mainland. The Scottish environment secretary said it could be the largest grouping of flame shells anywhere in the world. The colony was uncovered during a survey commissioned by Marine Scotland. It was conducted as part of work to identify new Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). The small, scallop-like species has numerous neon orange tentacles that emerge between the creatures' two shells. Flame shells group together on the sea bed and their nests create a living reef that supports hundreds of other species. The Loch Alsh flame shell reef is much larger than expected, covering an area of 75 hectares. Environment Secretary Richard Lochhead described the seas around Scotland as a \"hotbed of biodiversity\". \"With Scottish waters covering an area around five-times bigger than our landmass, it's a huge challenge to try and understand more about our diverse and precious sea life,\" he said. \"The flame shell must be considered among the most remarkable species in our waters, with a dazzling array of orange tentacles. \"Many would place such an exotic species in far-flung tropical reefs - not realising they dwell under the waves just off the coast of Skye.\" He added: \"This important discovery may be the largest grouping of flame shells anywhere in the world. \"And not only are flame shells beautiful to look at, these enigmatic shellfish form a reef that offers a safe and productive environment for many other species.\" The Loch Alsh survey was carried out by Heriot-Watt University on behalf of Marine Scotland. Dan Harries, of Heriot-Watt University's School of Life Sciences, said: \"Too often, when we go out to check earlier records of a particular species or habitat we find them damaged, struggling or even gone. \"We are delighted that in this instance we found not just occasional patches but a huge and thriving flame shell community extending right the way along the entrance narrows of Loch Alsh. \"This is a wonderful discovery for all concerned.\"", "question": "A huge colony of an @placeholder and brightly coloured shellfish species has been discovered in coastal waters in the west of Scotland .", "option_0": "uncommon", "option_1": "elusive", "option_2": "amateur", "option_3": "unknown", "option_4": "exciting", "label": 1}
{"article": "The 13 Premier League clubs in the fourth round made 98 changes to their line-ups, an average of 7.5 per team. Championship sides facing lower-league opposition also rotated players, with Leeds making 10 changes, while Brighton and Newcastle made nine. \"Clubs care about money while fans care about trophies. That's very unfortunate,\" Shearer told BBC Sport. \"It's just crazy, I don't understand it. I'm all for bringing kids into the team but not seven or eight of them. Six rounds from the third round to the final, it's not asking a lot is it?\" The rotation of players in the cup competition proved a talking point as Liverpool made nine changes and were beaten at Anfield by Wolverhampton Wanderers. On Sunday, Premier League sides Hull and Watford both rotated their squads and were knocked out by Championship Fulham and League One Millwall respectively, while an unfamiliar-looking Leeds were eliminated by non-league Sutton. However, seven top-flight sides who made five or more changes to their starting line-ups did make it through to the last 16. On Twitter, Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker said Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp showed a \"lack of knowledge of the depth in English football and respect\". Match of the Day pundit Phil Neville believes the changes are \"making the FA Cup better\", adding: \"It's been fantastic to see the upsets so far. Jurgen Klopp has to find out about those kids. He has a massive academy. If you don't play them, you don't know.\" Premier League sides have made an average 2.06 changes to their side from one league fixture to the next this season, a much lower figure than the average of 7.5 made over the FA Cup fourth-round weekend. But 14 clubs from the top tier are scheduled to play again in the league on Tuesday, with the remaining six in action 24 hours later. Southampton boss Claude Puel - who made 10 changes in defeat at Arsenal - said he would \"do the same again\". Watford's Walter Mazzarri  - who made seven changes for the loss at Millwall - said he was \"sorry\" and referenced a focus on Tuesday's Premier League trip to Arsenal, adding: \"I want a team that in the next 16 games fights for every ball.\" But former Arsenal striker Ian Wright said he could not understand Mazzarri's move, with Watford 14th in the league. \"I don't know what else they are playing for,\" said Wright. After defeat at non-league Sutton United, Leeds United boss Garry Monk admitted his rotation \"backfired\" as he kept an eye on getting the \"balance right\" for Wednesday's Championship fixture at Blackburn. There are now just seven Premier League teams guaranteed a fifth-round spot, while Leicester will contest a replay with Derby. At this stage in 2015-16 and 2014-15, 10 were left in the competition. Managers often like to use the line that \"we take each game as it comes\". But as the season enters February, with key fixtures, a busy Easter period and league run-ins on the horizon, it seems many of them are looking to future obligations. Is FA Cup success deemed enough of a reward? The winners will pick up £3.4m if all prize money for wins from round three through to success in a Wembley final is added together. By comparison, the difference in finishing a single Premier League place higher this season is expected to be £2m. Reaching the Champions League places is worth close to £11m and that is before taking into account television revenue and prize money for group stage points. It would be unfair to cite finance as a pure motivation for squad rotation, though ultimately it forms part of the reward managers are aiming for. Increasing recovery time for players is often central to the reasoning managers give for ringing the changes but former England captain Shearer claims he never got tired. When asked on Twitter if the game was quicker and hence more tiring for players, Shearer replied: \"They now have better diets, training and preparation. So shouldn't they be able to play more?\" Media playback is not supported on this device Media playback is not supported on this device Media playback is not supported on this device Media playback is not supported on this device Media playback is not supported on this device", "question": "Clubs making wholesale changes are \" @placeholder fans \" out of an FA Cup run , according to BBC pundit Alan Shearer .", "option_0": "cheating", "option_1": "declared", "option_2": "investigating", "option_3": "making", "option_4": "devastated", "label": 0}

Her daughter, Amanda, took her own life at her home in British Columbia. Before her death in 2012, the teenager made a YouTube video describing the bullying she had suffered. The experience led to her abusing drugs and alcohol. Eventually she began to self-harm. Carol said that Amanda began posting music videos online when she was 12 years old. \"She was a good singer, and so people started liking her videos and saying what a great voice she had,\" she told the BBC. \"Then, she started having a conversation with a teenage boy. This grew into what I suppose you would call an internet crush. \"Eventually, this boy convinced her to lift her top. And she did. \"Unknown to her at the time, this person took a picture at the other end and began to threaten her - if she didn't do what he wanted, he would post the picture to her Facebook page.\" The stranger knew everything about Amanda - her address, school, friends, and the names of her family members. Eventually, he posted her semi-naked photo online. Amanda was too embarrassed and afraid to tell her mother about the turmoil she was experiencing. \"In 2010, police arrived at my door,\" said Carol. \"I hadn't realised what was happening or that the photo had been published,\" she said.  She said her daughter was being bullied \"online and offline\". To make matters worse, Carol learned that the other person was not a 16-year-old boy, but a 35-year-old man living in the Netherlands. In the hope of ending the bullying and harassment, Carol moved her daughter to other Canadian schools, but her efforts to protect her daughter were fruitless. \"The internet travels everywhere,\" she said. \"Before she moved schools, the children at the next school would know already about what happened.\" Before she died, Amanda uploaded a video to YouTube describing years of bullying that, she said, drove her to drugs and alcohol. In the nine-minute video she told her story with a set of handwritten notes. The recording, described as \"haunting\", showed the former cheerleader going into detail about what happened to her. Appealing to Northern Ireland parents to be aware of the dangers online, her mother said: \"What I've learned in the last three and a half years is that what happened to my daughter is not an isolated case. \"If kids are going through these kind of things, they need to get support from friends, families, teachers and the police. \"We need to have the conversations with kids, to empower them.\" A number of investigations took place following Amanda's death.

However, no formal vote on the plan was taken as Mr Maskey did not want the committee to \"divide.\" So far there has been no official comment from the committee, but it is believed the idea was proposed by the TUV leader Jim Allister. Last week, the minister gave the committee a copy of the report into the conduct of the adviser, Stephen Brimstone. It was carried out by civil servants, but its findings had remained secret for 18 months amid allegations it had been \"buried\". The report recommended a formal disciplinary investigation into Mr Brimstone's behaviour. But a series of other conclusions and recommendations were concealed. One source said it would be up to the judge to decide the \"relevancy\" of the parts of the report that have up to now been hidden. The committee has been investigating allegations of political interference in the Housing Executive. They were raised in a BBC Spotlight programme in 2013. It is claimed Mr Brimstone ordered a DUP councillor to change the way she intended to vote at a Housing Executive Board meeting. The BBC has learned that Mr Storey sent a letter to Mr Maskey on Wednesday afternoon.

{"article": "HIV was resistant to the drug Tenofovir in 60% of selected cases in some African countries, according to the study, which covered a 17-year period. The research, led by University College London, looked at 1,920 HIV patients worldwide who had treatment failure. Lead author Dr Ravi Gupta said the results were \"extremely concerning\". The work, which took four years to complete, started in 2012 and compared certain patients with HIV in Africa with those in Europe using data from 1998 to 2015. Splitting the sample size roughly into two groups the study found that in Africa 60% of patients were resistant to Tenofovir, whereas in Europe the figure was only 20%. The paper, which has been published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases journal, said poor administration of the drug, in terms of regularly taking the right levels of Tenofovir could be explanation for the discrepancy. \"If the right levels of the drug are not taken, as in they are too low or not regularly maintained, the virus can overcome the drug and become resistant,\" Dr Gupta told the BBC News website. \"Tenofovir is a critical part of our armamentarium against HIV, so it is extremely concerning to see such a high level of resistance to this drug,\" he added. The paper also suggested that Tenofovir-resistant strains of HIV could be passed on from person to person. \"We certainly cannot dismiss the possibility that resistant strains can spread between people and should not be complacent. We are now conducting further studies to get a more detailed picture of how Tenofovir-resistant viruses develop and spread,\" Dr Gupta said. HIV is the world's most deadly infectious disease, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

He could be expelled if Labour bosses decide his comments were \"grossly detrimental\" to the party. On Tuesday morning he blamed the Jewish Chronicle and Labour MPs for misreporting his comments. And he said that if he was expelled from Labour he would take legal action to fight the decision. Mr Livingstone has been suspended from the Labour Party since the row erupted in April 2016, when he was defending MP Naz Shah over claims she had made anti-Semitic social media posts. The comment that sparked the row, was made to BBC London. The former mayor said: \"When Hitler won his election in 1932, his policy then was that Jews should be moved to Israel. He was supporting Zionism before he went mad and ended up killing six million Jews.\" What's the difference between anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism? Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Tuesday morning, he said it was a \"lie\" to say he had said Hitler was a Zionist, saying this had been the cause of offence. He has repeatedly defended his version of events, saying there had been \"real collaboration\" between Nazis and Zionists before World War Two. But Jeremy Newmark, of the Jewish Labour Movement, said Mr Livingstone's \"seemingly consistent need to calibrate his language to cause maximum hurt and pain to Jewish people and Holocaust survivors in this country has created a situation where there can no longer be a place for him inside our party\".

But the Department for Work and Pensions says food bank use has \"complex\" causes and it is \"misleading\" to point to any one cause. The food bank figures, from April 2016 to March 2017, show an increase of about 74,000 emergency supplies provided compared with the previous year, based on a network of more than 400 distribution centres. The charity says that delays in benefits, debt and insecure employment are among the reasons that people have to turn to food banks for help. In particular, the charity says that the introduction of universal credit seems to be causing a gap in benefits which causes families to turn to food banks. Trust chief executive David McAuley said the findings provided an \"early warning\" about \"unforeseen consequences\" from the benefits changes. But a Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said there were more complex reasons underlying the use of food banks. \"Under universal credit people are moving into work faster and staying in work longer than under the old system,\" he said. The food bank charity reports that more than 400,000 of the recipients were children. Official figures published last month show that most child poverty is now concentrated in working families.

A resurgence of a cholera outbreak has also resulted in 60,000 suspected cases since April and 500 associated deaths. Mr O'Brien said the suffering of Yemenis was not a coincidence, or the \"result of forces beyond our control\" - but rather the fault of those involved and inaction by world powers. \"The people of Yemen are being subjected to deprivation, disease and death as the world watches.\" \"Crisis is not coming, it is not looming, it is here today - on our watch,\" he added. Mr O'Brien said that despite \"very generous pledges\" at a conference in Yemen in April, the UN's appeal for $2.1bn (Â£1.6bn) for humanitarian aid was only 24% funded. For the past two years, the country has been embroiled in fighting between forces loyal to exiled President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi, backed by a Saudi-led multinational coalition, and those allied to the Houthi rebel movement. Al-Qaeda, meanwhile, has taken advantage of the chaos to reinforce its presence in the south and south-east of the country.

He said that money accrued from its re-use around the world belongs to him. \"It took three days of blood, sweat and tears to get the selfie in which I had to be accepted by the group of monkeys before they would allow me to come close enough to introduce them to my camera equipment,\" Mr Slater told the BBC. \"The trouble is, other people are trying to steal the ownership rights and I will fight to resist that.\" The selfie of the crested macaque monkey has been widely distributed around the world by numerous outlets, including Wikipedia. They and other outlets argue that the copyright to the images cannot be owned because they were taken by an animal rather than a person. Earlier this week, activists from the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) filed a lawsuit in San Francisco seeking permission for it to administer all proceeds from the photos for the benefit of the male monkey, which it identified as six-year-old Naruto. \"If Peta US prevails in this lawsuit, it will be the first time that a non-human animal is declared the owner of property, rather than being declared a piece of property himself or herself,\" Peta Director Mimi Bekhechi said. But Mr Slater told the BBC that the attitude of Peta and Wikipedia \"stinks\" and is a flagrant breach of his artistic integrity. He argues that it took \"much time and more perseverance\" to get the selfie, taken on a reserve on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi in 2011. He had to spend several days with the monkeys so that they became relaxed in his company. He said he only managed to get the photo by setting up his camera on a tripod with a cable release switch which the monkey in the famous selfie pressed. In addition, he had to make sure that the light and contrast switches on the camera were properly set - work which he says is more than sufficient for him to claim copyright of the photos. \"I was lying down at the time with at least two macaque juveniles on my back and nursing a few bruises from a male who had whacked me several times all over in the belief that I was a challenge to his females. \"So please don't tell me these photos are not my property.\"", "question": "The photographer at the centre of an international row over the ownership of a selfie photograph taken by a monkey in Indonesia has told the BBC that he will vigorously resist the @placeholder challenge to its copyright .", "option_0": "decisive", "option_1": "latest", "option_2": "new", "option_3": "controversial", "option_4": "upcoming", "label": 1}

It said that it had to weigh customer privacy against such requests. Prosecutors argue that the data could throw light on what happened. Police want any information from the Echo that may be on Amazon's servers on the night of Victor Collins' death. Mr Collins was found floating face up in a friend's hot tub in November 2015. The friend, James Andrew Bates, has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder. The suspect called the Bentonville, Arkansas police department to say he had found the body. According to court records, one of the deceased's eyes and his lips appeared to be swollen and suspected blood spots were found around the rim of the hot tub. Detectives said they learned that music had been streamed to the back patio at the time of death, which they said may have been controlled via the Echo's smart assistant Alexa. Lawyers for Amazon filed a motion last week asking a judge to throw out requests for Echo data to be handed over: \"Given the important First Amendment and privacy implications at stake, the warrant should be quashed unless the Court finds that the State has met its heightened burden for compelled production of such materials,\" its court filings read. And, in a statement to Associated Press, the firm added: \"Amazon will not release customer information without a valid and binding legal demand properly served on us.

The \"always on\" Echo speaker makes recordings of audio it hears from a fraction of a second before it detects a wake word - either Alexa or Amazon - until it judges the command to be over. This audio is then transmitted to Amazon's computer servers, which interpret the request and tell it how to respond. Although no recordings are meant to be made at other times, the device often becomes activated when it misinterprets speech as being its wake command. Any captured audio might therefore have identified who was active in the early hours of the morning when the alleged murder is thought to have taken place, as well as what was said. Mr Bates claims to have been asleep at the time.

About 98,000 pupils in Northern Ireland received a grant this year. The most that any individual pupil can receive is £78 which helps pay for uniform and PE kit for post-primary pupils. The instruction by the department to make the proposed cut was discussed at the most recent board meeting of the EA. An EA spokesperson told the BBC: \"In its recent Resource Budget Allocation letter, the Department of Education has instructed the Education Authority to make certain spending cuts to achieve budget savings. \"These include a reduction of £3m for school uniform grants.\" The BBC understands that, if implemented, the reduction in funding of about 60% would not reduce the number of applicants, but would reduce the amount of support each would receive. The school clothing allowance scheme helps pupils from low income families in primary, post-primary and special schools. Primary school pupils can receive £35.75 towards uniform costs. Post-primary and special school pupils can receive £51 towards their uniform if they are under 15 years old and £56 if they are over 15. Post-primary and special school pupils can also receive £22 towards paying for school PE kit. However, if the cut were implemented, each pupil would receive a reduced amount towards their school uniform. The department also confirmed that extended schools funding is being reduced by about £1.5m. Just over £10.6m was provided to around 400 schools in 2016-17 and this is being cut to £9.1m in 2017/18. The extended schools scheme gives schools in relatively disadvantaged areas some extra money.

It shows that in Northern Ireland the richest 10% of households have incomes 4.2 times higher than the poorest 10%.  In Great Britain the ratio is 5.1. The main reason for the difference is that Northern Ireland's highest earning households earn less than the highest earning households in Great Britain. Incomes at the bottom in Northern Ireland are roughly the same as in Great Britain. The research also looked at wealth which is measured by savings and property ownership. It estimated that the total savings wealth held by Northern Ireland households amounts to £11bn, while property wealth is £44bn. It concluded that in terms of savings there is a relatively high degree of wealth inequality, driven by the number of households who have no savings at all. In Northern Ireland 45% of households have zero savings compared to 33% in Great Britain. Savings of £20,000 puts a household in the top 10% of the Northern Ireland distribution but in Great Britain at least £70,000 is required to be in the top 10%.

{"article": "The Port Talbot-based Specific innovation centre is working on the concept of \"buildings as power stations\". The project involves Tata Steel, Swansea and Cardiff universities, and firms including BASF and Pilkington. More than half the funding is from the European Union. The technology being developed aims to enable homes, offices, shops and factories to generate, store and use their own solar energy. It involves creating innovative coatings for roofs, walls, steel and glass on buildings which can generate electricity. Scientists are also developing solar air collectors or steel \"skins\" which create cavities between the heated metal and the building to harness and store solar heat. They hope to create buildings which will not need a gas supply. One industrial unit in Port Talbot has already been generating all its own heat through solar power for the last three years. Kevin Bygate, chief executive of Specific said the potential was to deliver a \"game changer\" on energy: not only for buildings to become self-sufficient but for surplus energy to be stored and to supply the grid. They were close to reaching a target too when the technology could be incorporated into the design of new housing at no extra cost above the market price. \"At scale, it could deliver a significant reduction in gas heating, a reduction in the stress on the electrical grid at peak times, and a cheap, renewable source of energy for building owners and occupiers.\" Altogether 50 partners from across industry and academia are involved in the five-year programme. More than 130 scientists and product developers are working at the centre, which as well as labs has its own £6m pilot production plant. Other research includes heated floor tiles and coatings which can help water treatment. The funding announcement - which includes £15m from the EU - was made by Finance Minister Jane Hutt, who hopes it will help drive forward the energy industry. The rest of the money comes from the Engineering and Physical Research Council, Innovate UK, industry and the two universities.

The rebellion began on 24 April 1916 but ended after six days of fighting, and most of its leaders were executed. The document was sold by Adam's Auctioneers in Dublin on Tuesday. MacNeill's 11-word countermand is considered to be one of the most important documents in Irish history. The handwritten order reads: \"Volunteers completely deceived. All orders for tomorrow, Sunday, are completely cancelled.\" The rebellion had been due to begin on Easter Sunday 1916, but MacNeill's order caused confusion among the rebel forces and their insurrection was delayed until the following day. The brief, violent rebellion cost the lives of 450 people - more than half of whom were civilians - and resulted in widespread destruction of much of the Irish capital's inner city. The Easter Rising was defeated by the British forces within days, but the execution of 15 rebel leaders who survived the fighting roused public sympathy for their cause. The event is widely viewed as the catalyst for the Irish War of Independence two years later, which was followed by the partition of Ireland and the establishment of an Irish free state. MacNeill's handwritten countermand, the only known copy in private ownership, was put up for sale in Dublin, as the main attraction in a collection entitled 800 Years of Irish Political, Literary and Military History. The order was expected to sell for between 30,000 euros (£24,800) and 50,000 euros (£41,000) and the sale was agreed at the lower estimate. The identity of the new owner is not being made public, but the auction house confirmed the document was bought by a private collector who is based in Ireland. Last month, Kieran O'Boyle from Adam's Auctioneers said the document had \"changed the immediate course of Irish history to a significant degree\". He added that \"with the exception of the Proclamation itself, it is probably the most important and influential document of the period of the rising\". The Irish Volunteers had been planning to hold peaceful manoeuvres on Easter Sunday 1916. However, MacNeill found out that a group in the organisation, led by Padraig Pearse, had secret plans for an armed rising against the British. When MacNeill tried to countermand this, the result was chaos and confusion, especially in areas remote from Dublin, where local commanders could not establish what was going on.

Transport and Economy Secretary Mr Skates was giving evidence to the Welsh Affairs Committee's inquiry into the franchise on Monday. The AM for Clwyd South said lessons could be learnt from the current franchise, with passengers concerned about poor quality trains and a lack of capacity. The Welsh Government is committed to paying Arriva Trains Wales (ATW) a subsidy of Â£170m a year under the terms of a 15-year deal signed in 2003. He said talks between the Welsh Government and the Department for Transport had been constructive, but that historic under-funding needed to be addressed. Iwan Prys Jones, of the North Wales Economic Ambition Board, told the committee it felt like the network was \"a long way down the shopping list\" for improvements. Meanwhile, chair of the North Wales Business Council, Ashley Rogers, said investment could lead to the creation of 70,000 jobs. The four bids are being assessed by Transport for Wales (TfW), a Welsh Government-owned company, as part of what ministers said would be an \"ambitious and creative not-for-profit model\".

Of nine firefighters who were injured, five were taken to hospital. Investigators have recommended there be a review of training for driving during icy conditions. They have also recommended that the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) make arrangements for the gathering and sharing of information on weather that could affect driving conditions. The accident happened on the B9006 Inverness to Nairn road at about 07:15 while the two crews were going to the aid of two people trapped in wreckage following a road accident. The first appliance to hit the black ice skidded 180 degrees on the road before it struck a raised grass verge and rotated 360 degrees and landed on its side in the field. The driver of the second vehicle slowed down, but lost control after passing the point where the first appliance had skidded. The second fire engine also came off the road and ended up on its side the same field. However, the crew managed to alert the crew of a third fire service vehicle and it was stopped safely and remained on the road. Three of those involved in the crash were not wearing seat belts, according to the SFRS investigation. Lewis Ramasay, assistant chief officer at SFRS, said: \"The investigation established that the immediate cause of the crash was the two vehicles skidding on black ice. \"As a result, we are reviewing arrangements for gathering information on road conditions and how these may present specific route risks, in order to ensure that our crews are advised accordingly. \"We are also reviewing training in relation to driving in inclement weather and driver familiarisation with specific vehicles, although the investigation did not find this to be a contributory factor in the crash.\" The senior officer added: \"The role of a firefighter is one that is often dangerous and our job is to ensure that the risks associated with firefighting and responding to emergency calls are managed effectively. \"This starts from the minute a call is received and appliances are dispatched; our report recognises this and, as a result, we fully intend to use its findings to protect our crews, the public and any other road users. \"This incident is a powerful reminder of the risks faced by frontline crews and it shows how even highly experienced emergency response drivers in state-of-the-art vehicles can be affected by inclement road and weather conditions.\"", "question": "Black ice caused two fire engines to come off a road near Inverness and crash into a field , an investigation into the accident has @placeholder .", "option_0": "concluded", "option_1": "started", "option_2": "admitted", "option_3": "emerged", "option_4": "predicted", "label": 0}

{"article": "The Lao Securities Exchange opened for business on Tuesday with trading in just two companies. The country, sandwiched between Vietnam and Thailand, is one of the world's poorest nations. It is hoped that the stock exchange will help raise $8bn (Â£5.1bn) in equity and bond sales to fund investment in the country. The Laos exchange is initially offering shares in two state-owned companies, Electricite du Laos Generation company and Banque Pour Le Commerce Exterieur Lao. The volume of the first day's trading was thin, about 2.14bn kip ($265,000; Â£170,000). The communist country is hoping to follow the example of neighbouring China which has taken great strides in opening up its economy, albeit in a controlled way, greatly enriching itself and its citizens. \"I hope investors will support the endeavours of our stock exchange,\" said Dethphouvang Moularat, the head of the exchange (LSX), after a small opening ceremony. Laos is aiming to join the World Trade Organization and become more integrated in the global economy. The BBC's reporter in the region, Vaudine England, says that the stock exchange opening is aimed at foreign investors. Our correspondent says the government in Laos has been trying to attract foreign investment since the 1990s. The problem for the government, she adds, is that the majority of the population is engaged in subsistence agriculture, so there is very little infrastructure in the country. Despite the attractions for foreign investors in this resource-rich country, outside participation in the bourse will be limited at first. The funding for the set-up of the exchange has come from South Korea, which has invested $9.8m, or 49% of the capital, for the venture. The Bank of Laos, the country's central bank, has invested the rest.", "question": "Communist country Laos is experimenting with @placeholder by opening a new stock market .", "option_0": "technology", "option_1": "pride", "option_2": "difficulties", "option_3": "capitalism", "option_4": "options", "label": 3}

The figure rises to 46% for manual workers and the unemployed. Although inflation is currently low, many workers have not had pay rises for years. The Bank of England said last month that it expected inflation to increase in the second half of the year, which could put more pressure on some households. The survey of 1,648 adults across the UK was conducted by YouGov on 16 and 17 May. It found that 14% of those questioned could not pay a bill of just £100 without borrowing. Women were less likely to have spare cash than men, while almost half of those aged 18 to 24 would not be able to find £500, compared with 23% of those aged 65 and over. Many Americans are also in a similar financial position. Since 2013 the Federal Reserve has been asking US consumers how they would cope with a $400 (£276) emergency. This year 47% of respondents said they would have to either borrow, or sell something they owned to be able to find that much cash. The Money Advice Service has found that four in 10 UK adults have no more than £500 in savings, while a survey by ING bank suggested that 28% had nothing at all in their bank account. Family debt stood at an average of £13,520 at the start of the year due to the availability of cheap credit, according to Aviva. The figure had jumped by £4,000 in just six months to the highest since the summer of 2013, the insurer said. The Aviva report suggested that the typical family had a savings pot worth £3,150.

Hemingway was soon sent back to Europe to cover events such as the Greek revolution, and later, the Spanish Civil War. He began writing in earnest in his 20s while based in Paris.

{"article": "At the same time, the first minister's tone was intriguing as she confirmed, in a news conference at Bute House, that the SNP will vote against a proposed incursion by the RAF into Syria when the Commons debates the issue tomorrow. I questioned Nicola Sturgeon as to whether there was ever any serious doubt that the SNP would be in the No lobby of the Commons when the vote was taken. In response, she went out of her way to emphasise that this was a carefully weighed decision, preceded by detailed thought and discussion. Her tone eschewed political rhetoric. Indeed, she praised the prime minister's efforts to attempt to convince sceptics, indicating that he had made progress in that direction. She summed up the position as \"an honest difference of opinion.\" So what is driving this approach? Firstly, this \"nuanced\" view - Nicola Sturgeon used that very adjective - is driven by conviction. Within the SNP leadership, Ms Sturgeon has taken particular pains to stress that it was important to think carefully, particularly in the aftermath of the Paris attacks. She deliberately left the impression that this was not primarily a decision from pre-existing first principles but rather a careful, pragmatic calculation based on an assessment of all the elements, in Syria and globally. So Ms Sturgeon accorded weight to the Prime Minister's persuasion but argued that it fell short on two points; the lack of a credible ground force to support air strikes and the lack of planning for post-conflict reconstruction in Syria. Without those, she argued, air strikes might well make matters worse. There are of course wider political calculations. There are some who have been adamant against air strikes from the outset. Ms Sturgeon is not in that camp, matching perhaps the troubled thoughts of many in Scotland and the wider UK as they reflect upon Paris. Thirdly, the standpoint adopted by the SNP has the effect - intentional or otherwise - of contrasting with the uncertainty and disquiet in Labour ranks, reflected in the lack of a common position among Her Majesty's principal Opposition at Westminster.", "question": "The substantive issue could scarcely be more serious ; @placeholder UK involvement in air strikes against Syria in an effort to countermand a global terrorist threat .", "option_0": "lost", "option_1": "dominated", "option_2": "harmful", "option_3": "potential", "option_4": "major", "label": 3}

President Trump, in brief remarks at Mar-a-Lago following a dinner with Chinese President Xi Jinping, indicated that the strikes targeted the Syrian military forces that carried out the Idlib chemical weapon attack, an action he suggested \"crossed a lot of lines\". The response sent a message, that the use of chemical weapons in Syria carried consequences. While a dramatic display of military force, it is unclear what impact it will have on the ground. Fifty-nine cruise missiles are unlikely to change Mr Assad's no-holds-barred approach to the six-year old Syrian civil war. As Mr Obama discovered after negotiating the removal of most (but evidently not all) of Syria's chemical stocks in 2013, it still leaves the Assad regime free to use conventional weapons, and chlorine barrel bombs, to continue his assault on the so-called moderate Syrian opposition and civilians, backed fully by Russia and Iran. Given that reality, Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham have already encouraged the president to go further and take Syria's air force \"completely out of the fight\". Mr Obama feared just such a slippery slope. He chose to define America's vital interest in Syria more narrowly, defeating the so-called Islamic State without getting more deeply involved in another costly Middle East quagmire. Ironically, until today, so did Mr Trump, who opposed military action in 2013 and was elected to fix problems in America, not Syria.

Dundee United fought back after the interval through Sean Dillon's drive from outside the box and Blair Spittal hit the crossbar. But County held on and Jackson Irvine and Franks both had efforts blocked. The victory for Jim McIntyre's side makes it three league wins in the first month of the season, the first time the Highlanders have hit that mark prior to Christmas in their four seasons in the top flight. In contrast, the struggling Taysiders have made their worst start to a season in 12 years, with four points from six matches. Billy McKay went straight into the Dundee United starting line-up after completing his season-long loan from English League One side Wigan Athletic. The hope was the striker could reproduce the form that saw him score 62 goal in 141 games for Inverness Caley Thistle and compensate for the loss of Nadir Ciftci to Celtic. That, and the other players who have been sold by the Tannadice club in recent times, clearly still annoys their supporters who let chairman Stephen Thompson know what they thought of him early on. The travelling fans were unhappy when referee Craig Thomson awarded County a controversial penalty after 17 minutes for handball against Mark Durnan. It looked as though the former Queen of the South defender was pushed onto the ball by one of the Staggies players, but Thomson thought otherwise. Boyce celebrated his return to the Northern Ireland squad for next week's Euro 2016 qualifiers by ramming in the spot kick for his fifth goal in the last four matches. Ryan Dow twice raced clear but the visitors' slack finishing was nothing compared to their poor defending as the Dingwall side moved two goals clear. Ryan McGowan got back to make a goal-line clearance to deny Franks but from the winger's resulting corner Davies was allowed the space to clip in the Staggies' second after 28 minutes. United were much more aggressive after the break and Dillon brought them right back into the game with a goal that was as spectacular as it was rare from their captain. There seemed little threat when he picked up possession 30 yards from goal but the Irishman lashed home a stunning shot for only his sixth strike in eight years at Tannadice.

The exercise sparked an international scare and cost Fonterra and authorities NZ$37m ($25m; Â£18m) in investigations. New Zealand is the world's largest dairy exporter. The dairy industry forms the backbone of its economy. Kerr had pleaded guilty to two charges of attempted blackmail in sending the packages, which appeared to be a protest against the widespread use of 1080 in New Zealand. A judge ruled that Kerr, who owned a company that manufactured an alternative pesticide, had done it knowing that he would benefit financially if 1080 was banned. Justice Geoffrey Venning said Kerr's actions had \"posed a major threat to trading relationships between New Zealand and other countries,\" reported NZ Herald. Fonterra alone reportedly spent NZ$20m as it secured supply chains and conducted checks.

The case followed complaints from two people who had hired Hales to build extensions at their homes. Hales pleaded guilty to two charges at a previous hearing. The case - concerning homes in Belfast and Coagh, County Tyrone - was brought by the Trading Standards Service (TSS). One of the complainants paid Hales £25,500 to build a two-storey extension at his home. Hales obtained large advances for the work, which he carried out to a poor standard and then removed himself from the job entirely, leaving the home in such disarray that the householder and his family had to live in rented accommodation. An independent report estimated that only about £15,000 worth of work had been completed by Hales. The other complainant had plans drawn up and approved by Building Control which he provided to Hales. Hales replaced a block wall with a stud wall without checking the structural soundness of it with the structural engineer or building control. He also failed to stick to the agreed work and payment schedule. Eventually, the complainant was left with no option but to pay another builder to rectify and finish Hales' work.

Greenlight lets Steam users pledge support for games that Valve then helps appear on the service. Steam Direct will let developers get their games onto the service without first having to win over audiences to a title. In a statement setting out how Steam Direct will work, Valve said developers would be able to publish directly after they completed a sign-up process. The process will require developers to submit the same sort of information they would need to open a bank account, said Valve. In addition, it added, developers will have to pay a publishing fee. Valve said it had not yet decided how much this would be, but after consulting developers it said it  could range from $100 (Â£80) to $5000 per title. Valve said the fee would \"decrease the noise in the submission pipeline\" which many people interpret to mean is an attempt to discourage unscrupulous developers from submitting bad games as they have done with Greenlight. Many Steam regulars have complained that a lot of the games Greenlight shows off do not deserve publicity because they are poorly coded and derivative. Steam introduced a small fee of $100 for listing a game on Greenlight in a bid to discourage this practise. Games that become popular via Steam Direct will be able to recoup some of the fee they paid. \"We want to make sure Steam is a welcoming environment for all developers who are serious about treating customers fairly and making quality gaming experiences,\" said Valve. Developer Mike Gale said it was not clear that Steam Direct would stop bad games being published on the service. Writing on his blog, Mr Gale said it would probably mean far more games reached Steam because \"$100 - $5,000 is easier to come by than tens of thousands of votes required to pass the Greenlight system.\" He said the top end of the suggested fee was \"not unreasonable\" and was likely to be far less than many developers paid when creating console games.", "question": "Valve is changing the way @placeholder game makers can get their creations onto its Steam service .", "option_0": "japanese", "option_1": "independent", "option_2": "controversial", "option_3": "national", "option_4": "remaining", "label": 1}

{"article": "Canada's food guide first appeared in 1942 under the title Official Food Rules and was originally created to help Canadians stay strong and healthy despite meagre wartime rations. The guide recommended drinking fruit juice, loading up on bread and eating plenty of liver. Over the years, the publication has used many designs to illustrate the different food groups. In the US, the \"food pyramid\" became an instantly recognisable illustration of nutritional categories but Canada switched from a \"food wheel\" to a \"food rainbow\". The Canadian government used to be concerned about people getting enough food, now it's worried people are getting too much. In the new year, Health Canada will start drafting a new food guide aimed at getting people to eat less. Despite the commitment to changes, food historian Ian Mosby says the guide may have simply outlived its usefulness. \"It was started as a way to prevent malnutrition. But it's hard to see what it's doing in an era where those are not the main health problems facing Canadians.\" When the Canadian government released its rules for healthy eating in 1942, it was marketed as a guide to \"health-protective foods\". The rules laid out the bare minimum that a person should eat in order to stay nourished. \"Eat more if you can,\" the rules advised. Daily servings of Vitamin-C rich citrus fruit or tomatoes were advised, along with weekly servings of liver for iron. Food was expensive in the 1940s and 1950s, and overeating was a luxury few experienced. According to a 1955 survey of household spending, the average family spent about 30% of their earnings each week on groceries, the bulk of which was spent on meat and dairy products. But by the 1970s, rising incomes and the growing commercialisation of food had completely transformed how people eat, says Mosby. Sugary cereals, trans fats and TV-dinners became a staple of many people's diets. As the price of packaged foods high in sugar and salt plummeted, overconsumption became a bigger problem. The government could no longer just tell people what they should eat, they had to tell people how much. Consequently, the old black-and-white list of Official Food Rules got a Technicolor makeover and was transformed into Canada's Food Guide, a consumer-friendly guide for making better food choices. Critically, a warning to eat sugar, fats and salts in moderation was added in 1982. But Canada's overeating problem didn't go away. Since 1985, the obesity rate has tripled. Canadians are spending less and less on food overall, but more on eating out and sugary beverages. It's possible, food historian Mosby says, to be both obese and malnourished. In 2014, the average Canadian household spent just under C$6,000 (£3,622) a year on groceries, or 8% of their annual salary, including C$1,300 on beverages like juice and soda, which provide mostly empty calories. To encourage people to eat better, the most recent edition of the guide made produce, not grains, the main food group. But the guide hasn't gone far enough, says Canada's Health Minister Jane Philpott. Philpott is leading the charge to change the guide once again in the new year. She wants to make it simpler to understand and come down hard on processed foods and trans fats. Mosby says that if the guide hopes to remain relevant, it must be backed up with policy changes that make healthy eating more affordable and put limits on sugars and fats in foods. \"These issues are not going to be solved through education\" alone, he says.", "question": "Since World War Two , the Canadian government has been telling people what to put on their plate to stay healthy .

It was also told by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) to make improvements to several other systems and processes. The trust said efforts to address the issues were already under way. It follows an inspection by the CQC at the beginning of May. At the time it was announced chief executive of the trust, Paul Sutton, had resigned after it emerged Secamb had run a secret and controversial pilot during which up to 20,000 patients had their ambulances delayed. A review by Secamb said failings in how the trust was run led to the \"high risk\" project, which did not have approval from board members, the 111 NHS helpline or commissioners. The trust has until September to address the immediate concerns highlighted by the CQC, including problems answering NHS 111 calls and the availability of kit, before a full report will be published later in the year. Its action plan includes: This warning notice is piling the pressure on the ambulance service. A full inspection in May highlighted a range of issues, and this notice makes it clear some of those issues need sorting immediately. Problems answering the NHS 111 service are perhaps the most worrying for inspectors. Secamb is already  being investigated after it dodged national response targets to gain more time to assess some seriously ill patients. In a pilot project during the winter of 2014/15 the trust delayed sending help for certain 111 calls and transferred them to the 999 system, thus gaining an additional 10 minutes to respond. Here we are a year-and-a-half on and the NHS 111 system is still a major cause of concern for the CQC. Add to that issues with kit, medicines, staffing, a temporary chief executive, a temporary chairman and a huge demand on their services from us - the public - and this is an ambulance service struggling to cope. Acting chief executive of Secamb, Geraint Davies, said the trust was \"sorry for not providing the service that the communities we serve should expect and deserve\". He said: \"Along with the rest of the trust's executive team, our priority now is to focus on addressing the issues which the CQC has highlighted. \"We know that there is a lot that the trust needs to do to improve compliance with a number of systems and processes to ensure the safety of our patients. \"My aim is to restore public confidence and faith in our service.\"", "question": "A @placeholder - hit NHS trust which came under intense scrutiny over emergency call - outs has been issued with a warning notice by the health regulator .", "option_0": "national", "option_1": "free", "option_2": "scandal", "option_3": "special", "option_4": "mystery", "label": 2}

Det Ch Insp James Mitchell said he could not confirm whether or not he had seen it before, but he identified all of those named as members of the Provisional IRA.

An announcement could be made within days. In effect, the fine imposed by the British financial authorities will be the UK taxpayer paying the UK taxpayer, but there has been concern over how the US fine was to be paid. Senior sources at the Treasury said the chancellor had made it clear that the financial penalty imposed by American regulators must be covered by deductions from the bonuses of bankers at RBS. These would be either clawed back from previous years or deducted from future bonus awards. Two leading banks, Barclays and UBS, have reached settlements with regulators over their involvement with Libor (London Interbank Offered Rate), with fines of £290m and £940m respectively. Libor tracks the average rate at which the major international banks based in London lend money to each other.

The Washington Post said it hoped the referral represented \"a step forward toward Jason's prompt release\". Mr Rezaian, who holds dual US-Iranian citizenship, was arrested with his wife and two associates in July. The associates were released within weeks, while Yeganeh Salehi was freed on bail in October. In December, Mr Rezaian was brought before a judge in the Iranian capital to hear charges officially levelled against him and was denied a request for bail.

SNP MSP James Dornan expressed \"concern and frustration\" at their failure to explain the funding gap. His comments came in a letter to Cosla's education spokesman. Mr Dornan, convenor of the education committee, wrote to Councillor Stephanie Primrose expressing disappointment that councils have not provided promised information to explain the discrepancy. It follows the revelation by BBC Scotland in September that millions of pounds given to councils to pay for free childcare had not been spent on funding the programme, according to a government report. A financial analysis of the Scottish government's flagship childcare policy revealed that local authorities were given an extra £329m to fund the scheme. But it said they had spent or planned to spend just £189m of it on childcare. Local authority umbrella group Cosla disputed the figures at the time and said the report was a \"crude assessment\". They were then called to explain the underspend to the education committee at Holyrood last month and said they had \"concerns about the data that was used [in the financial review]\". They said they would provide information to refute the report but have so far failed to do so. The letter from Mr Dornan states: \"Your correspondence of 26 October stated that Cosla would endeavour to provide further information as quickly as possible. I reiterate my comments to you from 5 October that parents looking for funded childcare places who see a considerable underspend... have the right to an explanation.\" A spokesman for Cosla said: \"We are still finalising the figures and will respond to the committee next week.\" Mr Dornan's letter also refers to correspondence from the Cabinet Secretary in which he said: \"I am at a bit of a loss to understand how there can be a problem with the data because they were provided for formulation of the report by local government.\" The Scottish government has made childcare expansion a key priority. At the SNP conference Nicola Sturgeon announced plans for a consultation on new accounts that would allow the funding to follow the child rather than the nursery. Since August 2014, all children aged three and four as well as vulnerable two year olds in Scotland should be offered 600 free hours of childcare a year.

A relieved Maguire, the 2004 champion, admitted he got his chance to see the match out thanks to a fluked red. \"I was very lucky and he will be devastated,\" Maguire said. \"But it happens to us all.

While total global sales grew in the fourth quarter and full year, menu changes have eaten into growth. Analyst Neil Saunders said instead of it pulling new customers into McDonalds, people had been switching to cheaper meals, including the breakfast. Under president and chief executive Steve Easterbrook, McDonald's has been working on revitalising the business, which had been suffering under falling sales. Mr Easterbrook said on Monday: \"Throughout 2016, we worked diligently to lay the groundwork for our long-term future. We focused on driving changes in our menu, restaurants and technology to deliver an enhanced McDonald's experience for our customers around the world.\" Mr Saunders, chief executive of retail research business, Conlumino, said: \"In our view, as much as menu change was right, one of the impacts of the all day breakfast options has been to provide diners with cheaper options. Many have exploited this and average transaction values for lunch and dinner have fallen as a consequence, something that has put a dampener on overall growth. \"In this regard, putting to one side the initial uplift in interest when all day breakfast was launched, the initiative seems to have ultimately created quite a lot of menu choice switching rather than driving new customers to stores.\" Operating profit in North America for the three months to December also fell, down 11%, although the previous year's profit was flattered by a gain on the sale of a restaurant property. In other regions, growth was stronger.

A US state department official said the agency was working to secure the release of two other US nationals, Matthew Miller and Kenneth Bae, who remain in detention in North Korea. There were tearful scenes as Mr Fowle was reunited with his family. His children were brought to the base without being told their father would be on a plane home. Following the arrival, a spokesman for the family said Mr Fowle was feeling well. He was treated well by his captors but has requested privacy as he readjusts, his spokesman added. When asked directly how he felt, Mr Fowle gave reporters a thumbs up. The US had earlier accused North Korea of using detained Americans as pawns in a diplomatic game. Mr Fowle, 56, entered North Korea on 29 April and was detained in early June as he was leaving the country. He was charged with \"anti-state\" crimes. He was reported to have left a Bible in the toilet of a restaurant in the northern port city of Chongjin but his family have insisted that he was not on a mission for his Church. Missionary activity is considered a crime in North Korea. In August, he and fellow detainee Matthew Miller made a televised appeal to the US government to help secure their release. Responding to the appeal, the US authorities vowed to make securing the release of the detainees a \"top priority\". Mr Miller was later sentenced to six years' hard labour for committing \"hostile acts\". Washington had been trying to send high-level representatives to negotiate the detainees' release but those visits were cancelled by North Korea in recent months. Pyongyang has denied accusations that it is using the arrested Americans as diplomatic bargaining chips. US Secretary of State John Kerry has said there was \"no quid pro quo\" in Mr Fowle's release this week. \"We are very concerned about the remaining American citizens who are in North Korea, and we have great hopes that North Korea will see the benefit of releasing them also as soon as possible,\" he told reporters.", "question": "A US citizen released from detention in North Korea has been greeted to an @placeholder homecoming in Ohio .", "option_0": "emotional", "option_1": "independent", "option_2": "unwanted", "option_3": "explicit", "option_4": "unusual", "label": 0}

Brunt says the one benefit of suffering a torn anterior cruciate ligament, the first long-term injury of his career, is the chance to spend a bit more time at home with his children. \"It will be a long recovery period,\" he said. \"But I'm now off the crutches and can walk about and drive.

He is still reluctant to talk about the coin thrown by an angry Albion fan, which left Brunt with a cut cheek and lucky not to have been blinded. Instead, he prefers to talk about the response from disgusted Albion supporters, who held bucket collections for charity that day against Palace - and have continued to remain supportive. \"They were pretty ashamed of what went on,\" said Brunt. \"But the support I've had since has been great. \"It was good that we had all the collections for charity.

The letter was sent to Labour's Kezia Dugdale, Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, Willie Rennie of the Lib Dems and Scottish Green Patrick Harvie. It said: \"I hope that you will agree with me that all parties in Scotland must unite in making clear to the UK government that it is unacceptable for reductions to be imposed on this year's Scottish Budget. \"Not only do such reductions have a potentially damaging impact on our programmes and public services, but the chancellor's approach shows little respect for the role of the Scottish Parliament itself in approving the annual devolved Scottish Budget.\" Ms Sturgeon said the Scottish government would continue to argue for an alternative to the UK government's austerity programme. This would involve a \"moderate increase\" in public spending of 0.5% a year in real terms between 2016-17 and 2019-20, she said.

{"article": "Lord Mandelson made the comments in 1998, an era when income growth was 5.6% and inflation (the consumer prices index) was 1.4%. Real incomes were rising by a healthy 4.2%. Being relaxed about the rich was far easier when your income was also rising. The picture is now very different. Today's wage growth figures from the Office for National Statistics show a sharp decline to 2.3%, down from 2.6% the previous month. Inflation is now at 1.8%, up from 1.6%. Real income growth - admittedly on a slightly different measure from 1998 - is now running at 0.6%. Of course, these are one month's figures but the trend is clear. Inflation is rising, mainly a function of a weaker currency leading to higher import costs for things like food and fuel. And wage growth is slowing despite a robust employment market. As Matthew Taylor, the head of the government review into employment, told me, Britain is good at creating jobs and not so good at creating well-paid jobs. With economic growth predicted to slow next year, employees are still fighting shy of demanding significant pay increases. Productivity is still stubbornly low, which means that wealth creation per hour worked is limited. And in the public sector the pay freeze continues. This is the Prime Minister's significant and growing headache. She made an economy \"that works for everyone\" the cornerstone of her government's offer to the electorate. Falling real incomes do not fit comfortably with that narrative. And if the incomes squeeze translates into falling consumer confidence, then the main driver of the better than expected economic news since the referendum could turn more negative. As Torsten Bell of the Resolution Foundation said: \"Our pay recovery is now rapidly ending. \"Pay growth is already zero on single month data and we expect 3 month growth to be just 0.2% next month.\" Put aside Brexit, the Scottish referendum, Donald Trump - when it comes to the economy, falling incomes is becoming the real and present political danger.", "question": "When Peter Mandelson said the Labour Party was \" intensely relaxed \" about people becoming filthy rich ( as long as they pay their taxes ) he was saying something far more @placeholder than he maybe realised .", "option_0": "outrageous", "option_1": "radical", "option_2": "powerful", "option_3": "obvious", "option_4": "fundamental", "label": 4}

But warning signals were visible up to 40 years before whale stocks collapsed. The work appears in Nature Ecology and Evolution journal. Christopher Clements, from the University of Zurich in Switzerland, and his colleagues looked at records on the abundance and body size of whales caught by commercial whaling vessels between 1900 and 1985, after which a global whaling moratorium took effect. \"We looked at data on blue, fin, sei and sperm whales and found significant declines in body size, with sperm whales taken in the 1980s four metres shorter on average than those in 1905,\" said Dr Clements. This probably occurred as the biggest individuals were selectively removed from the ocean through hunting. \"This means that warning signals were detectable up to 40 years before a population collapse,\" Dr Clements added. A similar pattern has previously been reported for many fish populations, and has been interpreted as a response to fishing pressure. The results suggest that tracking changes in the mean body size might help to predict when populations are at risk of collapsing. \"Our technique could be used to help provide other species of conservation concern.

It accused church staff of repeatedly failing to provide up-to-date details of individuals involved in the church's finances, which it said was vital to fight money-laundering and fraud. The church says the bank has since reopened the account and apologised. The \"giving account\" is used by the church for hundreds of parishioners to make donations by standing order, and has a monthly turnover of nearly £20,000. Church volunteers say that initially they could not understand why the information was being requested, and assumed it did not apply to them. When they did realise, they say the bank offered little support. In the end, it gave them a final deadline and then closed the account. HSBC did reopen the account at the end of last week after speaking to officials from St Nicholas, and has promised to try to work with the church to resolve the situation. As a result of the closure, many standing orders have bounced, and the church was forced to write to parishioners to ask them to pay the missing money by cheque instead. \"We've had this account for a very long time,\" says the Rev Linda Williams. \"Many of our parishioners are now worried, asking, 'Where is my money? Where is my standing order?'\" She says the giving account is vital for the church's finances. \"The big thing at this time of year is our utility bills. If we have a cash-flow problem, we'll have to take the money out of reserves, and we can't continue like that.\" Church treasurer Peter Timms is furious at HSBC's actions. \"I personally think the bank have been acting like little dictators,\" he says. \"This was very heavy-handed treatment, particularly for a charity run by volunteers. Banks should know their customers, and exercise a bit of common sense.  If they're concerned, they should speak to us properly.\" The details demanded were part of HSBC's controversial Safeguard programme. It was set up in response to the bank being fined £1.2bn in 2012, over money laundering and sanctions busting. As a result, it agreed to spend hundreds of millions of pounds on a global \"know-your-customer\" programme. This in turn meant many existing retail and business customers were asked for detailed personal information, with the warning of account restrictions and closures if they failed to comply. Money Box has heard from other HSBC retail customers, charities and businesses angry at the level of information being demanded and the threatening letters they have received. Some have had accounts closed or restricted. Others have moved their banking elsewhere in protest. Dennis Stamps, the rector of St Nicholas, admits the church should have responded to the requests sooner, although he still doesn't understand why an existing customer would be asked for such detailed information. \"The person handling this account is an accountant by training, but she couldn't understand why the form was being sent to us, and how it applied to our particular charity. \"When we got another letter she was still perplexed about the information really being requested, so she inquired about that.\" He also accuses the bank of failing to be supportive. \"When we realised we were struggling to complete the forms they wanted, we asked for an extension on closing the account, but the account was closed.\" HSBC said it would not comment on specific accounts, but said Safeguard was designed to protect customers' own interests by aiming to detect and protect against financial crime. \"This includes asking existing customers to provide additional information about themselves and the intended nature of their business with HSBC to make sure that our records are up-to-date and accurate,\" the bank said. \"While we understand this may cause some inconvenience for our customers, it is an important step we need to take to protect our customers' interests. \"Where a customer doesn't supply all of the information that we have asked of them, HSBC may be forced to close the customer's account.\"", "question": "A parish church in Hertfordshire says it has potentially @placeholder thousands of pounds of donations after its bank account was closed for a fortnight .", "option_0": "lost", "option_1": "accusing", "option_2": "negative", "option_3": "enhanced", "option_4": "defended", "label": 0}

It and a proposed building of a nearby town has been dubbed \"Zumaville\". Provincial authorities have said the road development plan preceded Mr Zuma's presidency. But the Democratic Alliance has questioned why so much emphasis is being placed on this area of South Africa. The BBC's Pumza Fihlani, in Johannesburg, says many development plans and road upgrades across the country, some of which are urgently needed, never get off the ground often because of lack of finance or corrupt tenders. On Sunday, it was revealed that South Africa's Public Protector Thuli Madonsela had opened an investigation into the publicly funded construction of Mr Zuma's private residence in the district of Nkandla. The chalets and state of the art security are said to have cost $27m (£17m). The unveiling by the KwaZulu Natal government of two new nearby road networks, costing $67m, happened two days later. The Democratic Alliance's Ian Ollis said that he would request that Ms Madonsela extend her investigation to include the road upgrades leading to Mr Zuma's homestead. \"KwaZulu Natal certainly has enough road and transport infrastructure projects which could have been considered as alternatives to the Nkandla projects,\" Mr Ollis said. But KwaZulu Natal's Transport Minister Willies Mchunu said the road project was above board and various villages had been marked for development before Mr Zuma came to power in 2009. \"In fact, former President Thabo Mbeki identified Nkandla and Msinga as priority areas needing development. This has nothing to do with President Zuma,\" South Africa's Mercury newspaper quoted him as saying. In recent months, there has also been controversy over proposals for a town to be built about 3km (two miles) from Mr Zuma's Nkandla homestead. \"Public funds should not be spent to service the home and the hometown of the president to the detriment of other projects that are meant to improve the lives of ordinary South Africans,\" Mr Ollis said.

Earlier on Tuesday, in a rare clash between the German judiciary and the state, Mr Range said the government had asked him to drop an independent investigator from the inquiry, who concluded that one of the articles published did amount to a disclosure of a state secret. The request, said Mr Range, amounted to \"an intolerable encroachment on the independence of the judiciary\". He said that while the freedom of press was valuable it was not \"limitless\". But now the justice minister has said he no longer has confidence in the chief prosecutor and will request his dismissal. Mr Range is 67 and was due to retire next year. Munich's chief public prosecutor, Peter Frank, has been named as his successor. The state investigation, into two journalists at the website, is currently paused. The journalists involved have called for the case to be dropped.

{"article": "To be clear, there will be no English-style academies, no grammar schools or selection on the basis of academic ability. What may change significantly is the role of councils in the system. In many respects, the school system is a national service which Scotland's 32 local authorities are entrusted to deliver. The government has no intention of removing schools from council control - the question is more what powers councils may retain. The presumption in this review will be to give as much power as possible to schools and head teachers. If any power lies at a higher level, the case will need to be made for it. As well as devolving powers to schools, new regional boards will help schools in different council areas work together. The question is what actual powers and practical responsibilities councils will still have once these changes take effect. For instance, schools may have more control over their budgets, how many teachers to have or what means to use to try to raise attainment. Because teachers' terms and conditions of employment are nationally agreed, it might be argued that the new regional bodies - not councils - should actually employ teachers. All those issues are likely to be raised in the coming months. The direct impact on parents and learners may be less obvious - much would depend on the practical decisions made by newly-empowered schools. However, an important question will be how to ensure that schools remain accountable to parents and the wider local community. The Scottish Conservatives asked whether schools could be given the power to \"opt out\" of local government control - a power which they do not currently have. It would not be unreasonable to speculate over just what \"local government control\" will actually mean once the impact of this review is being felt in practice. Councils will still be major stakeholders in schools.

{"article": "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the measure ended an \"absurd situation\" whereby someone who \"supports terror\" was allowed to serve in the Knesset. But critics said it was anti-democratic and aimed mainly at Israeli Arab MPs. The law would require three-quarters of the Knesset's 120 members to vote in favour of any impeachment motion. The move comes a week after the European Union warned that the Knesset had risked undermining democracy and freedom of speech by approving legislation that requires NGOs receiving most of their funding from abroad to declare so publicly. A spokeswoman for the Association of Civil Rights in Israel expressed similar concerns about the new impeachment law, which was approved by 62 votes to 47 early on Wednesday. \"It harms the very building blocks of democracy - the right to freedom of expression, the right to vote and to be elected, and the right to representation,\" said Debbie Gilad-Hayo. \"Arab [MPs] whose actions and remarks do not find favour with the political majority will be the first people harmed by the bill - however, it is a slippery slope and the bill has potential to affect all,\" she added. Israeli Arabs are descendants of the Palestinians who remained after the State of Israel was created in 1948. They now make up about 20% the Israeli population. In February, three of the 18 Israeli Arab MPs caused outrage and were suspended from parliamentary activity for several months by an ethics committee after they met the families of Palestinians killed while carrying out attacks on Israelis. Thirty-three Israelis have been killed in knife, gun and car-ramming attacks since October. More than 200 Palestinians - mostly attackers, Israel says - have also been killed in that period. The assailants who have been killed have been shot either by their victims or by security forces as they carried out attacks. Other Palestinians have been killed in clashes with Israeli troops. On Tuesday, a 12-year-old Palestinian boy was killed during a clash in the occupied West Bank town of al-Ram, the Palestinian health ministry said.

{"article": "The claim: The government plans to cut one-third of hospital beds in England. Reality Check verdict: We do not have enough data to put a figure on the proportion of beds that will close under current plans. Only one-third of local NHS plans give any information about bed closures. He was referring to the Sustainability and Transformation Plans (STPs), which are the plans that local NHS areas have been asked to come up with to change services in order to make themselves financially sustainable. They are part of NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens' Five Year Forward View. England has been divided into 44 areas, each of which has its own STP. Although some of the STPs have quite precise plans, others are quite vague. That means it is difficult to come up with a precise figure for the number of beds being closed. In fact, according to Labour Party health researchers, only 14 of the 44 STPs mention bed closures. That is one-third of the STPs, although that might just be a coincidence. Mr Corbyn's team has been unable to show Reality Check where he got the number that he used in Parliament. Among the STPs with the most precise figures was Derbyshire, where 535 of 1,771 beds will be cut by 2020-21, a cut of 30%. West, North and East Cumbria plans to reduce beds in cottage hospitals (smaller hospitals, often in rural areas) from 133 to 104, with beds at Cumberland Infirmary and West Cumberland Hospital going from 600 to 500. That's an 18% cut overall. It illustrates another difficulty with these figures, which is that not all beds are the same. Having an acute bed is not the same as having a bed in a day unit or an A&E bed, for example. Also, some of the plans involve trying to treat people in ways that do not involve using hospital beds, through the use of home treatment, for example, which makes it harder to interpret bed closure figures. So an overall figure for bed closures would need a great deal of clarification, but it is clear that we do not yet have enough data to reach such a figure.

The allegations included permitting an animal to be in distress and for failing to provide proper food and standards of care for the animals in question. No animals were removed from the park.

The prosecutor told the OSPCA it could have proceeded on three charges, but it was not in the public interest, said spokesperson Melissa Kosowan. \"We are extremely disappointed in this outcome and feel that this matter is of public interest as all animals rely on humans for appropriate care for their general welfare and the public demands this,\" Ms Kosowan said.

{"article": "But the judges have banned the practice of refunding the bride price on the dissolution of a marriage. The custom of paying bride prices is widely practiced in Africa, but traditions vary, as some BBC Africa colleagues explain. A bride price here is known as \"lobola\", where the groom's family presents either money or cows or both to the bride's family as a gesture of his willingness to marry her. The payment of lobola is a sign of the man's commitment to take care of his wife and is seen as a symbolic act and a necessary part of upholding culture, rather than a purchase. The term \"lobola\" is also used in southern Zimbabwe, but in Shona communities it is known as \"roora\" and while the tradition is to give cattle, this is now often replaced by cash - the amount is subject to negotiation. There are several stages to the tradition and it is seen as a way of thanking the bride's family for bringing her up, but there is no sense that the bride is being bought. The payment of bride price is customary in Senegal but largely symbolic. A small amount of money and a kola nut is given to the bride's family at the mosque, after that the sum handed over can be any where from less than $100 to tens of thousands. The Kenyan constitution outlaws the obligation to pay a bride price but it is widely understood that it will be paid. Pastoral communities insist that it is paid in cattle and it has been cited as a cause of cattle rustling, whereas families in other communities will accept cash. There is a sense that a transaction has taken place over the bride. The bride price is commonly paid in Burkinabe culture and is largely a symbolic act. There is no set amount and a little money is given, but it is mainly in goods such as kola nuts, drinks, cigarettes - and some ethnic groups may give a goat. However, a bride's family is not normally too demanding. In Niger there is an official maximum rate for a bride price of 50,000 CFA francs ($83, Â£54) but many pay much more than this.

{"article": "MEPs, including European Parliament chief Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstadt say the proposal is a \"damp squib\". It offers Europeans in the UK fewer rights than Britons in the EU, they say in a joint letter to newspapers. Cabinet Office minister Damian Green said the \"basic rights\" of EU citizens living in the UK would be \"preserved\". He urged Mr Verhofstadt to \"read our proposal\", which the UK government insists would allow about three million EU citizens to stay on the same basis as now. EU migrants who had lived in the UK for five years would be granted access to health, education and other benefits. But the prime minister's proposals would be dependent on EU states guaranteeing Britons the same rights. The leaders of the four political groups who have signed the joint letter account for two-thirds of the votes in the European Parliament. Their letter points out that that they have the power to reject any Brexit deal before it can go ahead because the parliament must approve the withdrawal agreement. The leaders said they would not endorse anything that removed rights already acquired by citizens. They said the UK proposal \"falls short\" because it would take away rights citizens currently have, and create new red tape and uncertainty for millions of people. The letter said this contradicted promises made by the Leave campaign that EU citizens would be treated no less favourably after Brexit. By contrast, the letter said the EU's offer - already on the table - was simple, clear and fair because it promised that all citizens, including UK nationals living in Europe, would be treated equally and lose no current rights. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Verhofstadt said EU citizens in the UK - and Britons living on the continent - should keep their current rights, rather than the government \"inventing a new status\". What the UK is offering EU citizens? In full: Safeguarding the position of EU citizens What is the EU offering UK citizens? In full: EU's essential principles on citizens' rights \"It creates a type of second class citizenship for European Citizens in the UK,\" he added. \"We don't see why their rights should be diminished and that would be the case in the proposal. \"In the end, it is the European Parliament that will say yes or no, and I can tell you it not will be a yes if the rights of European citizens - and also the rights of UK citizens living on the continent - will be diminished [and] cut off, like it is at the moment.\" The letter stated: \"The European Parliament will reserve its right to reject any agreement that treats EU citizens, regardless of their nationality, less favourably than they are at present. \"This is a question of the basic fundamental rights and values that are at the heart of the European project.\" It added: \"In early 2019, MEPs will have a final say on the Brexit deal. We will work closely with the EU negotiator and the 27 member states to help steer negotiations.\" A spokesperson for the UK government said the letter contained a \"number of inaccuracies\" which could cause unnecessary and needless concern to UK and EU citizens. Mr Green, who as first secretary of state is a close ally of Theresa May's, told BBC Radio 4's Today that it was clear that EU citizens would have to comply with \"basic\" immigration rules after the UK leaves the EU to establish their identity and nationality. But he insisted: \"That is not an insuperable barrier. We all fill in forms when we go on holiday and have to get visas and all that.\" He suggested the UK was doing \"precisely\" what the EU was calling for. \"Somebody who is here now will keep the rights they already have and we hope that British citizens living in other EU countries will keep the rights they already have...the basic rights will be preserved so that should not be an obstacle to a final deal.\" Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning", "question": "Theresa May 's offer to give EU citizens in the UK \" @placeholder status \" after Brexit has been described as being \" far short of what citizens are entitled to \" .", "option_0": "lost", "option_1": "settled", "option_2": "investigates", "option_3": "offers", "option_4": "thrive", "label": 1}

Fulwell 73 responded to the animal rights charity in a statement. \"We have the upmost respect for organisations such as Peta and we support them greatly for their passion and incredible dedication,\" it said. \"We vetted Steve Martin closely and chose him based on his exemplary treatment of animals, his highly regarded reward-based training, and his history in contributing to animal conservation educational programs.\" According to the production company, Steve Martin has also worked with animals on the film sets of The Bourne Legacy, True Blood, The Zookeeper and Dances With Wolves.

Quite often it's glaringly obvious that comments have been written without the story being read, even just in part.

The study found the fish often swim towards open waters, have trouble selecting suitable habitats and are slow to respond to danger. Pollution impairs their ability to survive in key environments like the Great Barrier Reef, the authors said. The international study monitored what happened when six species of fish were exposed to oil in their first three weeks of life. The equivalent of even a few drops of oil in a Olympics-size swimming pool created \"dramatic alterations\" in behaviour, according to the researchers. \"Our oil-exposed fish were not making good choices,\" co-author Dr Jodie Rummer, from James Cook University, told the BBC. \"They were choosing [to settle in] open water or piles of dead coral. These types of choices would make them much more vulnerable to a predator.\" When researchers simulated a predator attack, the fish were sluggish to respond and did not move in the right direction. \"The fun, quirky way that we have described this whole response is like being drunk - you are making poor choices,\" said Dr Rummer. \"That is exactly what these fish were doing.\" Dr Rummer said such decision-making could compromise fish populations and the overall health of coral reef systems. \"The effects of the oil concentration lingered because we saw decreased growth rates and also a decrease in survival,\" she said. \"It is not like they got used to it - they did not up their tolerance for gin and tonic - they got worse over time.\"", "question": "Small amounts of oil can cause coral reef fish to engage in @placeholder behaviours , according to a new study .", "option_0": "special", "option_1": "harmful", "option_2": "risky", "option_3": "ancient", "option_4": "dramatic", "label": 2}
{"article": "Communities Secretary Sajid Javid and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt were told less than 24 hours before the launch. Costs of residential and domiciliary care were to be taken from the estates of pensioners bar a final Â£100,000. But it proved so controversial that the proposal was changed within four days. Prime Minister Theresa May embarked on a hasty retreat after Tory candidates complained that the policy was hugely unpopular. She said that an unspecified cap, which she described as an \"absolute limit\", would be imposed on care costs. BBC Two's Newsnight has been told that Mr Hunt and Mr Javid were informed of the proposal for the manifesto at a late hour because future social care policy was being examined in the Cabinet Office rather than in their departments. Ben Gummer, the then Cabinet Office minister who was co-author of the manifesto, was taking the lead in drawing up a Green Paper on social care due for publication later this year. It is understood that the proposal to preserve a maximum of Â£100,000 in estates of pensioners who need residential and domiciliary social care had been examined in great detail ahead of the Green Paper. The cap was due to be included but was still being examined. Cabinet ministers were consulted extensively in other areas of the manifesto. But ministers were only shown the whole document shortly before its launch in Halifax and 20 minutes before the media. And the head of the prime minister's policy board during the election also told Newsnight that he was not even shown a draft of the manifesto. George Freeman, the MP for Mid Norfolk, said: \"This was a catastrophe of a campaign and I wouldn't expect necessarily in a snap election it gets signed off by cabinet and it goes through a series of negotiations presumably and discussions. \"So I wouldn't expect to be holding the pen on the last draft. But I didn't see any draft. And I think there was a culture in the campaign of 'we the five or six of us are going to do this'.\" Members of Theresa May's inner circle feel deeply bruised by the fallout over the manifesto. Tory sources say that the prime minister was motivated by fairness on social care, asking why a 30-year-old in the north should subsidise the care needs of a pensioner living in a million pound house in the South East.", "question": "The two cabinet ministers responsible for social care were informed of plans for the so - called @placeholder tax just hours before it was announced in the Conservatives ' election manifesto .", "option_0": "inheritance", "option_1": "dementia", "option_2": "influence", "option_3": "latest", "option_4": "era", "label": 1}

The news sparked calls for a boycott of Lancome in Chinese online forums. Lancome cancelled the event citing \"possible safety reasons\" without clarifying if she was set to perform. Lancome also added, in a post on Facebook, that Ms Ho, 39, was not the brand's spokesperson. Ms Ho expressed her \"deep regret\" over the cancellation in a statement later on Monday, and asked for a public explanation from Lancome about the decision. \"Lancome is an international brand. Of course, even an international brand has to fall to its knees in the face of this kind of bullying. We have to seriously face up to this problem,\" she said. Ms Ho was one of the first celebrities to be arrested for participating in the pro-democracy Umbrella Movement in 2014, when thousands of people occupied parts of Hong Kong to demand fully free elections. The pro-democracy protest was seen by observers as the biggest challenge to Beijing's rule since Hong Kong was returned to China by the British in 1997. She had formerly posted pictures of herself with Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama, calling him a \"loving grandfather\". Lancome announced the concert last week and Ms Ho said on her Facebook page that she would be performing. Then on Saturday, Beijing newspaper Global Times questioned her appearance, calling her a supporter of Hong Kong independence in a post on micro-blogging site Weibo. Ms Ho has not publicly expressed her support for independence for the territory from China.

{"article": "Javier Pastore's volley gave Laurent Blanc's side a half-time lead, as Lille appealed for offside. Djibril Sidibe equalised with a free-kick, before PSG midfielder Adrien Rabiot was sent off. Di Maria rolled in the winner as keeper Vincent Enyeama inexplicably charged 30 yards from goal to meet the winger. Victory means that PSG remain on course for a clean sweep of domestic trophies, having won the Trophees des Champions and Ligue 1, and with the Coupe de France final against Marseille to come on 21 May. Manager Blanc's future, though, remains uncertain because of his failure to take the club beyond the quarter-finals of this season's Champions League, where they were defeated by Manchester City. Di Maria shot weakly at Enyeama in the opening seconds of an entertaining final at the Stade de France, with Lille looking the more dangerous side after surviving a difficult opening 10 minutes. Frederic Antonetti's team had won six successive games going into the final, but went behind to a controversial goal five minutes before before half-time. Pastore lashed a shot at goal as Lille struggled to clear a corner, with PSG full-back Layvin Kurzawa standing in an offside position inside the six-yard box as the ball flew into the net. The officials ruled that Kurzawa was not active because he did not move towards the ball, but Enyeama believed that he was effectively prevented from diving to save the shot because the PSG man was in the way. Lille responded positively, though, with Sidibe directing a free-kick into the corner of the net four minutes into the second half after Adrien Rabiot had been booked for fouling Sofiane Boufal. Rabiot picked up a second booking, and was dismissed, for a late challenge on Boufal with 20 minutes left. Lille, though, gave away a soft goal four minutes later, as Adama Soumaoro's weak back header allowed Di Maria to sprint on to goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu's clearance, and the Argentian international nicked the ball past the onrushing Enyeama.

David Mainstone, prosecuting, said Hughes told the online Hope Line Crisis Centre 20 August: \"I am a suicidal gunman with a real passion for hating the police. \"Do you think you can talk me out of being the next Dale Cregan or Raoul Moat?\" He also wrote on an online helpline: \"I am thinking of dropping off the planet, but I will have a lot of fun before I go and repay those who hate me and put me in this mindset.\" Hughes said he wanted to commit suicide and take as many police officers as he could with him. Staff were so concerned by his comments in two separate calls that they alerted the police. Officers who went to his home recovered weapons which were lawfully held because they were antiques. Andrew Green, defending, said Hughes made drunken empty threats and had no intention of carrying them out.

{"article": "The Office for Budget Responsibility now expects the economy to grow by 2%, up from its previous forecast of 1.4%. However, growth is then expected to slow to 1.6% the following year, before gradually accelerating to 2% by 2021. The OBR expects government borrowing for 2016-17 to be £51.7bn - a fall of £16.4bn from its November forecast and £4bn lower than the 2016 Budget figure. By 2021-22 the deficit is forecast to fall to £16.8bn. Government borrowing is expected to fall from 3.8% of GDP last year to 2.6% this year. The figure would then rise to 2.9% in 2018-19, but fall to 0.7% by 2021-22 - the lowest rate in two decades, according to the chancellor. Philip Hammond said his Budget would \"fund all additional spending decisions\", and that would allow the government to avoid additional borrowing. He said some had argued that lower government borrowing could permit higher spending, but he disagreed. \"Britain has a debt of nearly £1.7 trillion - almost £62,000 for every household in the country. Each year, we are spending £50bn on debt interest - more than we spend on defence and policing combined,\" he told MPs. \"And borrowing over the forecast period is still set to be £100bn higher than predicted at Budget 2016.\" The OBR said: \"The government remains on track to meet its targets for the structural deficit and public sector net debt. \"The government does not appear to be on track to meet its stated fiscal objective to 'return the public finances to balance at the earliest possible date in the next Parliament'.\" The OBR also raised its forecast for inflation this year from 2.3% to 2.4%. This figure was too conservative, said Rebecca Piggott, research fellow at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, which expects CPI inflation to peak at about 3.7% at the end of this year. \"We think the OBR's projections for real income and consumer spending growth are too optimistic,\" Ms Piggott said. The rate of CPI inflation is then expected to fall to 2.3% in 2018-19 - slightly lower than its previous forecast - and drop further to 2% in 2019. Jonathan Loynes, chief economist at Capital Economics, said the OBR's caution had deprived Mr Hammond of an additional Brexit \"war chest\" that some had predicted. \"If we are right in expecting the economy to remain rather more resilient than the OBR expects, then public borrowing will clearly fall rather faster and give the chancellor more elbow room,\" he said. \"For now though, the big picture is still one of a substantial further tightening of fiscal policy over the coming years.\" John Hawksworth, PwC chief economist, said Mr Hammond's reluctance to boost spending was understandable given the OBR made little change to its medium-term projections for either economic growth or public borrowing. \"Facing many economic and political uncertainties around Brexit and other geopolitical events, it was prudent for the chancellor to protect the £26bn headroom he left himself in meeting the new fiscal target he set out in the Autumn Statement,\" he said. \"But, given the OBR's view that the underlying economic position has not changed materially since November, the chancellor was not able to add to this headroom despite his cautious overall Budget judgement.\" The OBR was implicitly assuming a soft Brexit, according to Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. \"The intensity of exports and imports, as well as immigration flows, are assumed to decline gradually, rather than falling sharply as they might after a hard Brexit. Like the OBR, we expect a soft Brexit, but the risks lie towards a worse outcome.\"", "question": "The UK economy 's growth forecast for this year has been @placeholder sharply higher by the Budget watchdog .", "option_0": "condemned", "option_1": "declared", "option_2": "approved", "option_3": "revised", "option_4": "placed", "label": 3}

{"article": "A cabinet source has said that a \"big reset\" on subsidies paid by consumers, which push up household energy bills, is coming in the autumn. \"There is a hardening view in the cabinet that we've got to deal with green subsidies,\" the source added. Last month, the government announced that new onshore wind farms would be excluded from a subsidy scheme from April next year. Within a few weeks, the solar power industry is expecting its subsidies will be cut. The issue of renewable energy subsidies was discussed at the weekly meeting of the government's most senior ministers on Tuesday. Subsidies to the renewable energy industry, paid for by consumers, are expected to add up to Â£4.3bn this year. This week, the think tank Policy Exchange said the average household energy bill has risen by Â£120 over the last five years due to what they called \"ill-thought through energy and climate policies\". A spokeswoman for the Department for Energy and Climate Change said: \"Reducing energy bills for hard-working British families and businesses is this government's priority. We've already announced reforms to remove subsidies for onshore wind, and that work to make sure bill payers are getting the best possible deal is going to continue.\" But the renewable energy industry fears a cut now could seriously damage an industry at a crucial point in its development. \"We are getting very anxious about what might be coming,\" Leonie Greene, from the Solar Trade Association, told the BBC. \"The British industry is already very significant today. It employs over 30,000 people and turns over billions of pounds. It is quite clear that globally this industry is going to be worth trillions.

General Electric (GE) has offered $16.9bn (Â£10bn) for Alstom's energy business. Reports on Wednesday suggested that Mitsubishi and Siemens may make a rival offer for the energy business. In May, GE pledged 1,000 new jobs in bid to secure a deal with Alstom. The French government, which can block foreign takeover bids for companies deemed \"strategic\", has made job preservation a priority at Alston, which is one of France's key industrial firms. Some analysts believe the government will give a cool response to the latest move, fearing it would mean the break-up of Alstom. Christopher Dembik, an analyst at Saxo Banque, said: \"When you look at the offer in detail you are convinced it will mean the complete dismantlement of Alstom which the government fears. \"Such an offer has two problems: first the question of control of the nuclear activities and then we are far from the famous Franco-German energy giant,\" he said. French President Francois Hollande will hold a meeting on Thursday morning to review developments on the sale, said Economy Minister Arnaud Montebourg. Alstom had to be bailed out by the French government in 2004, and has suffered heavy debts and a fall in orders over the past 10 years.", "question": "Japanese engineering giant Mitsubishi has joined forces with German firm Siemens to come up with a @placeholder offer for France 's Alstom .", "option_0": "promotional", "option_1": "fresh", "option_2": "major", "option_3": "secret", "option_4": "suitable", "label": 1}

{"article": "But Spanish football isn't just about the 'big three' and there are plenty more storylines to savour as the campaign unfolds including intriguing managerial changes, top-flight novices with a bizarre nickname and a draconian new rule. BBC Sport has the full story... They have lifted the Champions League trophy twice in three years, but Real Madrid have won only one league title in the past eight seasons - and the big question at the start of the new La Liga campaign is whether they will finally be able to wrest domestic supremacy away from Barcelona. Zinedine Zidane's men, pipped by their great rivals by just a point last season, made a strong start, winning their opening game 3-0 at Real Sociedad on Sunday. That included two goals from Gareth Bale, who needed only 72 seconds to score the opener. Bale's outstanding performance was timely, adding further credence to an increasingly popular theory that he is gradually usurping Cristiano Ronaldo as the key player at the Bernabeu. The Welshman was excellent last season, bouncing back from an underwhelming 2014-15 campaign to produce his best form in Spain so far. And with Ronaldo understandably becoming more of a penalty-box predator as he advances into his early 30s, it does seem that Bale - along with fellow former Tottenham player Luka Modric - is Real's main man in terms of developing play. It has been an unusually quiet summer for the Bernabeu club, whose only foray into the transfer market has been re-signing former youth team striker Alvaro Morata from Juventus to compete with Karim Benzema. But that lack of activity could prove to be a blessing for Zidane, who already possesses world-class talent in every position and could have seen the balance of his squad disrupted by the arrival of yet another unnecessary but expensive 'Galactico'. And one new star is rapidly emerging: 20-year-old winger Marco Asensio, who spent last season on loan at Espanyol, has returned to establish himself in Zidane's plans by scoring brilliant goals in the Uefa Super Cup victory over Sevilla and the league opener at Real Sociedad. Remember the name. Standing in Real's way, of course, are a Barcelona team who began the season in ominous fashion with a magisterial 6-2 thrashing of Real Betis at home on Saturday. Although Luis Suarez - last season's leading scorer in La Liga - scored his fourth hat-trick in six league matches, the headlines were taken by Lionel Messi, who scored twice as part of a dazzling performance which touched dizzying heights even by his own unique standards. There is a distinctly new look to the Barca team this season - and not just because of Messi's dubious combination of peroxide blond hair and thick ginger beard. After a summer of strengthening in the transfer market, three players made their debuts against Betis: France defenders Lucas Digne and Samuel Umtiti, and former Manchester City youth midfielder Denis Suarez. In addition, gifted Portuguese creator Andre Gomes has been signed from Valencia and the Catalan club are still hoping to secure a back-up striker to Luis Suarez before the transfer window closes. Valencia's Paco Alcacer is the leading candidate. Although none of the signings - except, perhaps, Umtiti - are likely to feature in Barca's strongest XI, manager Luis Enrique now has more opportunity to rotate his squad and therefore prevent the burnout which nearly derailed their title challenge last season. But the key for Barca remains, of course, their astonishingly successful 'MSN' forward line - Messi, Suarez and Neymar - who have combined for an incredible 260 goals in their two (and a bit) seasons together. If that trio stays fit and in form, the champions will take some stopping. After finishing just three points off top spot last season, there is every reason to believe Atletico Madrid will mount another serious challenge for the title they snatched from under Barca's noses in 2014. When two Champions League finals are added to their consistent high finishes in La Liga, it's clear they have transformed themselves into genuine superpowers since the arrival of Diego Simeone in late 2011. The all-encompassing power of Barca and Real, however, means Atletico rarely receive their share of the limelight - even in their own city - and are routinely overlooked by pundits and bookmakers, who rate Los Rojiblancos as big as 14/1 shots for the title. Barca are slight odds-on favourites ahead of Real. Although Atletico's campaign got off to a disappointing start as, without suspended star striker Antoine Griezmann, they were held to a 1-1 home draw by Alaves last weekend, it would surely be unwise to write them off too soon. The indefatigable Simeone has kept hold of the squad which came so close to glory last season and added further quality in the form of livewire French striker Kevin Gameiro, whose goal in Sevilla's Europa League final victory over Liverpool was his 29th of the season. The all-French partnership of Euro 2016 top scorer Griezmann and Gameiro is a tantalising prospect, and we don't have to wait for long to discover whether Atletico can be contenders again - they travel to Barcelona on Wednesday, 21 September. Basque club Deportivo Alaves reacted to winning the Segunda Division at the end of last season in a strange manner: they sacked their promotion-winning coach and got rid of most of the players. But, last weekend, the new-look team, now led by former Valencia boss Mauricio Pellegrino and featuring seven debutants, partially vindicated that ruthlessness by making an impressive start to their first top-flight campaign since 2006 with a draw against Atletico. Alaves, best known for their 5-4 defeat by Liverpool in the 2001 Uefa Cup final, are perhaps not even the most famous sports club in the city of Vitoria-Gasteiz. The town's basketball team, Baskonia, are among the most successful in Spain and last season reached the semi-finals of Euroleague, the continent's leading club competition. In fact, Josean Querejeta, the chief executive of both clubs, reportedly had a novel response this summer when Barcelona's basketball team attempted to sign one of Baskonia's star players - he asked if Alaves could have Barca's reserve full-back Douglas in return. Neither deal went through. Elsewhere, another newly promoted team, Leganes, fared better on the opening weekend with a 1-0 victory over Celta Vigo. Leganes, where Samuel Eto'o started his senior career after a loan move from Real Madrid, are undoubtedly the fairytale team of the new season, with their 8,000-capacity Batarque stadium preparing for the first top-flight campaign in the club's history. The Madrid-based minnows are also notable for possessing maybe the strangest nickname in football: The Cucumber Growers. This summer they have been running a marketing campaign entitled 'Now Try Our Cucumbers', while their victory in Vigo came in their change strip... all green, of course. The other newly promoted side are more familiar, with Osasuna returning to the highest level after an absence of two years. La Liga's great entertainers should be Sevilla under the bold leadership of new coach Jorge Sampaoli, who made his name by winning three domestic titles in Chile before taking the national team to Copa America glory on home soil in 2015. Sampaoli is a famously attack-minded coach, and Sevilla's playing formation in last weekend's opener at home to Espanyol could best be described as 2-3-2-3, featuring wing-backs who spent very little time anywhere near 'back'. In a sign of things to come, Sevilla beat Espanyol 6-4 - the first time there has been such a scoreline in La Liga since 1956 - with all the home team's goals scored by summer signings. Franco Vazquez, a new arrival from Palermo, is one man to watch in particular. Another team to keep an eye on are Las Palmas, who were one of Spain's best sides in the latter stages of last season and made the summer's most eyebrow-raising signing with the capture of former AC Milan star Kevin-Prince Boateng. Boateng scored a brilliant header on his debut as Las Palmas maintained their pre-season optimism with a 4-2 away victory over Valencia on Monday, and they could well prove to be this term's surprise package. Elsewhere, two familiar faces are back in the dug-out as former Real Madrid and Tottenham boss Juande Ramos takes charge of a promising team at Malaga, while ex-Brighton and Sunderland chief Guy Poyet has been appointed by Real Betis. Don't worry Gus, you don't have to play Barcelona every week... If you are watching a La Liga game and notice fans seem to be crammed into certain parts of the ground while other areas are left vacant, there is a good reason. Increasingly aware of the need to compete with the English Premier League for the lucrative overseas television market, La Liga's bosses have realised a game played in front of packed stands provides a much better TV product, conveying a sense of atmosphere and excitement. To counter the unfortunate fact many Spanish grounds are often well below capacity (not helped by the league's unhelpful fixture scheduling), the authorities have taken the drastic step of introducing a new rule which will see clubs fined if the stand facing the main TV camera is less than 75% full. The league's rule book \"strongly recommends accommodating season-ticket holders and other spectators\" in the necessary seating, with judgments to be made on the decidedly low-tech basis of photographs taken by delegates after 30 minutes of each match. It's too early to tell how strictly the league will apply their bizarrely authoritarian new 'incentive', but there is comfort for clubs such as Deportivo La Coruna and Real Sociedad in the notoriously wet northern regions of Spain - the rule does not apply when it rains. Fitness permitting, Cristiano Ronaldo should reach a significant milestone midway through the season. The Real Madrid star is 22 goals behind England legend Jimmy Greaves as the leading all-time scorer in Europe's major five leagues (England, France, Germany, Italy and Spain).

Observers say it is a sign that India is emerging as a major player in the multi-billion dollar space market. The record for the most number of satellites launched in a single mission belongs to Russia, which sent up 37 satellites in 2014. The US space agency Nasa launched 29. As Indian scientists and government ministers kept a close watch, the rocket carrying 20 satellites blasted off from the launch facility in Andhra Pradesh state.

The BBC's Sanjoy Majumder in Delhi says it is a significant moment for India's space programme which has recorded a number of achievements including sending probes to the Moon and Mars. Launching several satellites in a single mission reduces cost and India has been positioning itself as a key player in the lucrative international commercial space market as an effective but low cost operator, our correspondent says. The chairman of the state-run Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro), Kiran Kumar, told the NDTV news channel that launching 20 satellites in a single mission was like \"allowing birds to fly in space\". \"Each of these small objects that you are putting into space will carry out their own activity, which is independent of the other, and each of them will live a wonderful life for the finite period for which they have been designed,\" he said, ahead of the launch.", "question": "India has successfully launched 20 satellites in a single mission , the most in the history of the country 's @placeholder space programme .", "option_0": "ambitious", "option_1": "latest", "option_2": "active", "option_3": "influential", "option_4": "manned", "label": 0}

A doctor told a Belfast inquest into his death that marks were found on his face and neck after his death. Assistant state pathologist Dr Peter Ingram said there were \"a considerable number of worrying injuries, principally to the neck or face, for which no satisfactory plausible explanation has been proffered\". He said: \"The possibility of strangulation cannot be excluded. The possibility of smothering needs also to be considered.\" Dr Ingram said it was highly unlikely some of the injuries were sustained during attempts to resuscitate Mr McCollum. Mr McCollum had spent most of his life in care and had been in the Randalstown home for almost a decade. He was fed through a peg as he had difficulties swallowing and was lifted in and out of bed using a hoist. Mr McCollum could not control his head and used a board to communicate. Despite his challenges, he was in good form before his death, his sisters said. Irish state pathologist Marie Cassidy was asked to examine post-mortem findings. She said no satisfactory explanation had been provided for some marks. There were deep bruises to the neck but no trauma to the skeleton and the cause of death was undetermined. Ms Cassidy said: \"It cannot be excluded that the injuries were caused by a third party.\" Staff nurse Mary Harraghy, who carried out CPR, did not notice any marks on him bar a blemish on his collar bone before she handed him over to paramedics. She believed elastic from the oxygen mask could have caused the damage when he was moved from the bed to the floor by the emergency team. Another possibility coroner Joe McCrisken is investigating is whether Mr McCollum fell from his bed. A fit could be another explanation, Mr McCrisken added. Claire Thompson was one of the last people to see him alive and in a statement she said she noticed yellow marks on his neck after she returned from calling an ambulance because he had became poorly. She said: \"They shocked me and made me feel uneasy.\" When asked about this on Monday she was unable to remember many of the details.

Barclays has not admitted wrongdoing in agreeing to the settlement, which includes a censure. The regulator said that between January 2010 and June 2015, Barclays failed to supervise adequately procedures that saw many customers swap one mutual fund for another. In many instances, the benefits of switching funds may have been undermined by the transaction costs, it added. More than 6,100 fund switches took place during the five-year period A total of $8.63m was lost by customers in this way during the five years and most customers were not warned by the bank of the cost of switching before doing so, the regulator said. Finra added that from March to August 2014, Barclays processed 1,723 fund transactions, or 39% of those it reviewed, that were inconsistent with its customers' investment aims, risk appetite or other investments. The fine comes two months after Barclays appointed former JP Morgan senior executive James \"Jes\" Staley to the role of chief executive and signalled its renewed focus on investment banking. Mr Staley is in the process of cutting costs within the bank and disposing of assets that are not seen as core to the business.

{"article": "The winning film, I Daniel Blake, marks the 13th time that Loach, the director of more than 50 movies, has competed at the event. It's also exactly 10 years since he won the same prize for his 2006 Irish drama The Wind That Shakes The Barley, starring Cillian Murphy. Loach uses I, Daniel Blake to expose the welfare system in the UK, and says he wants the film \"to break audience's hearts, but also to make them angry\". Daniel Blake, played by stand-up comedian Dave Johns, is an older man living in Newcastle who, because of a heart attack, can no longer do his job. However, a mobility test by the Department of Work and Pensions declares him fit for work and while he waits for his appeal, Daniel Blake can only claim Jobseekers Allowance. His inability to take any work offered means his money is stopped, and he begins to go hungry. Loach, a social campaigner for most of his career, believes the current criteria for claiming benefits in the UK is \"a Kafka-esque, Catch 22 situation designed to frustrate and humiliate the claimant to such an extent that they drop out of the system and stop pursuing their right to ask for support if necessary\". \"The state's attitude is not an accident,\" he claims. \"The poverty, the indignity, the humiliation people go through is consciously done. \"The state is knowingly inefficient or cruel, knowing that people will be driven to frustration, despair, hunger and possible suicide. \"Claimants are portrayed as 'scroungers' in the media but research has found that less than 1% of claims for benefits are fraudulent. \"That's certainly less than the figures for tax evasion, for example. \"But there's an attitude that suggests that if you're poor, it's your fault. If you are out of a job, it's your fault. It's done to get the numbers down and the most vulnerable in our society are suffering as a result.\" Half a century ago, Ken Loach wrote the screenplay for the BBC play Cathy Come Home, which examined homelessness in Britain in 1966, and the director says his latest film \"is a snapshot of how life can be lived in Britain in 2016\". \"We wanted to explore the human consequences of welfare policy in terms of relationships, and who people become through these policies.\" Loach and his long-time collaborator, writer Paul Laverty, spent several months visiting British cities such as Stoke, Newcastle, Liverpool and Glasgow, meeting people seeking work, or on low-paid or zero-hour contracts. \"We started in my home town of Nuneaton and met a young lad there who was sleeping on a mattress in a charity home. \"He was doing the odd bit of work on zero-hour contracts, he'd given up on benefits - he said it was too humiliating. \"He hadn't worked for a couple of weeks, and the week before he hadn't eaten for four days. \"I opened his fridge and there was nothing in it - nothing at all. And this was one of the first people we encountered.\" Loach and Laverty say they also based a pivotal scene in the film, where a mother arrives at a food bank having not eaten for days, on a real anecdote from one of the centres they visited in Glasgow. \"Food banks have been praised by the state without any sense of shame at all and yet it's appalling in 2016 that people are having to make the choice between food and heating, which is common. \"After the war in 1945, we were desperately poor in Britain, but there is no way people would have been starving, their communities wouldn't have let them. \"That we now have this situation is testament to the policy of individualism that successive governments have pursued. \"It's shocking that we are apparently such a wealthy nation with such grotesque wealth at the top and such desperate poverty and fear at the very bottom.\" The film has won widespread acclaim from critics, with Variety magazine calling it \"one of Loach's finest films, a drama of tender devastation, a work of scalding and moving relevance\". But despite its concentration on the UK welfare system, Loach, who will be 80 next month, insists that the movie also applies to an international audience. \"There is a conscious cruelty in the way we organise our lives now which means the most vulnerable people in society, such as the disabled, are caught in this unfair situation. \"They are often unable to live with dignity, and instead suffer pain and deep despair. \"It's deeply shocking that this is happening at the heart of our world.\" I, Daniel Blake will be released in the UK later this year", "question": "Two years ago he suggested he would be retiring from film - making , but instead 79 - year - old director Ken Loach has won the @placeholder Palme D' Or award for the second time at the Cannes Film Festival .", "option_0": "overwhelming", "option_1": "french", "option_2": "humble", "option_3": "improved", "option_4": "coveted", "label": 4}

{"article": "But the fact it was Facebook doing the buying came almost out of nowhere. News of the $2bn acquisition immediately trended on Twitter - provoking a mixture of surprise and, in a lot of cases, anger. Here's a round-up of reaction from around the web. Gaming news website Kotaku began by reflecting the tone of discussion with this opening line: \"Facebook has just announced that it's buying Oculus Rift for $2 billion. Seriously.\" It goes on to point out a posting on social news site Reddit one month ago in which an anonymous user wrote: \"No way to confirm this, but my friend works in the same building as Oculus, and he ran into Mark Zuckerberg taking the elevator to Oculus' floor.\" Following the news, a user returned to the prophetic post to write simply: \"I laughed at this, now I'm crying.\" On The Verge, Joshua Topolsky speculated on the bigger picture. \"As a service, Facebook is inspiring, as a platform, Facebook is scary,\" he wrote. \"That company now controls one of the most exciting technologies of the past fifty years. \"A truly revolutionary product that has reignited a dream many felt was all but dead and gone. What it will do with that technology is the only question that remains.\" While Oculus Rift can be used for many purposes, it is, at its heart, a device with which to play video games. For the past couple of years, a raft of games developers has been experimenting with the kit, adapting their games to work well with the hardware. But Markus \"Notch\" Persson, creator of the wildly popular online game Minecraft, did not hide his views. \"We were in talks about maybe bringing a version of Minecraft to Oculus,\" he tweeted. \"I just cancelled that deal. Facebook creeps me out.\" But another high-profile developer, Doom-co-creator John Carmack, dismissed any suggestion it was bad news. \"For the record, I am coding right now, just like I was last week. \"I expect the FB deal will avoid several embarrassing scaling crisis for VR.\" Then again, Mr Carmack's views are to be expected - he was hired by Oculus VR last year to be its chief technology officer, and stands to make some serious money from the deal. A perhaps more independent view comes from Dutch gaming company Vlambeer. The firm's \"business and development guy\" Rami Ismail told Engadget that Facebook was the \"household name\" Oculus needed. \"Facebook is a huge established tech presence, has amazing engineers, hardware, software, public mind-share and lots of money,\" he said. \"I mean, I am not a big fan of exits as a business model at all, but in light of not really having a profitable business model, it makes total sense for them to exit.\" Oculus Rift's development was possible thanks to crowdfunding - 9,522 backers pledged $2,437,429 (Â£1.5m) to get the product off the ground. Many of the product's early backers returned to the fund-raising page to give their opinions on the buyout. \"Shame on you Palmer, shame on you,\" wrote user Xod, referring to Palmer Luckey, Oculus VR's founder. \"A terrible move indeed, I'm so upset at the idea that this great community of generous people kickstarted Facebook.

{"article": "The government eventually sold its 40% stake in early 2015 for almost double the estimate by financial advisers. That was good news for the taxpayer, but it underlined a \"repeated tendency\" to undervalue assets, the Public Accounts Committee said in a report. The PAC also criticised delays in publishing data on the HS1 rail line. MPs said it was \"unacceptable\" that there was a two-year delay by the Department for Transport in publishing an evaluation of Britain's first high-speed rail line. It meant that important information that could have been used by Parliament to consider other projects, including the HS2 high speed line, was not available. The PAC claimed it denied Parliament the ability to use \"important information\" when considering HS2. Meg Hillier, the committee's chairwoman, said the issues over the Eurostar sale and the HS1 report \"raise serious questions about the government's approach to valuing public assets, as well as its commitment to considering the value for money of public spending on such expensive projects\". She highlighted concerns that the sale of Royal Mail, whose shares soared after its stock market flotation, was also undervalued. The Treasury, the PAC concluded, relies too much on a \"small pool\" of financial advisers. The government's 40% holding in Eurostar was sold for £585.1m to Patina Rail, an investment consortium. But the Treasury, and its advisers UBS, put a price tag of £305m on the stake. The sale of the government's entire stake in Eurostar has netted £757m, although that is far less than the estimated expenditure on the project of £3bn, the PAC said. A Treasury spokeswoman said: \"The government welcomes the committee's conclusion that the sale of our stake in Eurostar was well-handled and secured a good return for the taxpayer. \"Releasing public assets we no longer need is at the heart of our long-term plan to tackle Britain's debts and boost economic growth, and that's why we've recently identified up to £4.6bn of further asset sales, to help build on the huge progress we've already made.\" She said it would be misleading to suggest the government \"set out\" to undervalue its assets and added that its approach to Eurostar was approved by an independent adviser.", "question": "The sale of the UK government 's stake in the Eurostar train @placeholder is \" further evidence \" of assets being undervalued , according to MPs .", "option_0": "crisis", "option_1": "justice", "option_2": "service", "option_3": "group", "option_4": "line", "label": 2}

The report, A Nation of Renters, says that among these 740,000 households are 510,000 children while 180,000 of them have a disabled resident. And it says landlords are receiving £5.6bn a year on rent for homes with category 1 hazards - the most severe - which includes £1.3bn in housing benefit. The report also says: Ms Guy added: \"The government has rightly said it wants to tackle the country's housing crisis - it must make targeting dodgy landlords, giving tenants better rights and driving up standards a major part of that effort.\" Citizens Advice says there are now more than a million families raising children in privately rented homes in England - three times higher than a decade ago. It also says private renters are under-protected and that taking court action against a landlord can be a lengthy, complicated and expensive process.

The sprinter, who rides for Quick-Step Floors, added that TUEs have \"no space in our sport anymore\". In October 2016, Kittel said that athletes with severe asthma have \"no place in competitive sport\" if they need otherwise banned medication to treat it. Wiggins, who retired in December, has come under scrutiny after the his confidential medical information was leaked by hackers 'Fancy Bears' in September 2016. TUEs let athletes take prohibited substances if there is a medical need and 36-year-old Wiggins was granted a TUE to take anti-inflammatory drug triamcinolone before the 2011 Tour de France, his 2012 Tour win and the 2013 Giro d'Italia. Wiggins' TUEs were approved by British authorities and cycling's world governing body the UCI, and there is no suggestion either he or Team Sky have broken any rules. \"I don't think that anyone who is seriously sick should use those TUEs or, if he has to use them because he needs to recover from an injury or whatever, then he should also take time and really recover from it and then come back afterwards,\" added Kittel, who has won stages in each of the three Grand Tours.

{"article": "He had promised to wait until the Senate passed the 2017 budget, which it did earlier in the day. President Sergio Mattarella will start consultations with political parties over forming a caretaker government at 18:00 (17:00 GMT) on Thursday. In the meantime, Mr Renzi is to act as a \"caretaker prime minister\". The consultation, which is due to end on Saturday afternoon, will look at where support lies for a new government, a presidential aide, Ugo Zampetti, told reporters on Wednesday. According to Reuters, Mr Mattarella is expected to ask a member of Mr Renzi's cabinet, or a politician from his Democratic Party (PD), to try to form a new government. However, some are calling for the election, due in 2018, to be called early. Italians voted on Sunday by a margin of 59% to 41% against Mr Renzi's plans for constitutional reform, prompting his decision to stand down. The BBC's James Reynolds in Rome says Mr Renzi may have stood down as prime minister, but he still wants to stay on the frontline of politics. He remains the leader of the biggest party in parliament, the PD, and will play a considerable role in suggesting the name of his replacement. Before heading to the Quirinale presidential palace, Mr Renzi told the PD it should only participate in a \"government of national responsibility\" if it has the support of the other political parties. Otherwise, he said, \"the PD is not afraid\" of early elections. Two of the big winners in Sunday's referendum, the anti-EU Northern League and anti-establishment Five Star Movement, are pushing for early elections. But other parties, such as the centre-right Forza Italia, are trailing in the polls and want elections delayed. Forza Italia leader Silvio Berlusconi, 80, had tests in a Milan hospital on Wednesday, six months after he had heart surgery. Names suggested as a possible leader of a new administration include PD Finance Minister Pier Carlo Padoan and Senate leader Pietro Grasso, who is apolitical. According to a source quoted in Italy, President Mattarella believes it is \"inconceivable\" that elections can be held before electoral laws governing both houses of parliament are synchronised. The law was changed to the so-called \"Italicum\" system last year to give the leading party a parliamentary majority through bonus seats in the lower Chamber of Deputies. But there has been no such change in the Senate, which is elected by proportional representation. Senate reforms were part of the package rejected on Sunday. Another factor is that the constitutional court will rule on 24 January on whether the lower house reforms are legitimate. Italy's political turmoil has also led to days of uncertainty in international markets, amid questions over the fate of Italy's indebted banks, especially its third largest, Monte dei Paschi, which is seeking €5bn (£4.2bn; $5.3bn) to recapitalise.

Rakuten also banned the sale of sea turtle products on its site, telling AFP news agency it was responding to \"growing international concern\". \"We expect it will take 1-2 months for all listings of these prohibited products to be removed,\" it said. On the day of the announcement, a large number of ivory items were still listed for sale, including many carved personal seals known as \"hanko\". Sellers of such items are expected to maintain careful records of their origin, and use only government-regulated ivory stockpiles. But activists believe the rules are often circumvented and the precious material is often smuggled across borders. Yahoo Japan, another site which allows the sale of ivory, has previously come under fire for the practice. However, a spokesman told Reuters it did not plan to halt the trade, saying: \"We don't think that the legal ivory trade in Japan has any impact on African elephant numbers.\" \"It is important to recognise there are cultural differences between different countries,\" he added.

The attack happened close to the scene of a bus bombing on Tuesday that killed 28 Shia pilgrims. This remote part of western Pakistan is plagued by kidnappings and drug traffickers as Balochistan ethnic nationalists wage an insurgency for more autonomy. Mr Colorado had arrived from Iran on Tuesday evening. He was urged by the authorities to spend the night at a local police station before being assigned a 12-man armed escort, in two vehicles, for his onward journey. Soon after setting off, a group of armed men attacked the convoy, shooting dead at least six of the  guards and wounding five others.

Mr Singh, who has more than 3.6m followers on Twitter, said the large concentration of people living in the area who came from the South Asian diaspora was the reason for his visit. \"I was told it has been a while since anyone had come to Bradford and usually stuff happens down south,\" Mr Singh said. \"It is a good move to come here because there are so many people who are interested in Hindi films who are based here.\" Alongside his co-star and co-star Vaani Kapoor he also unveiled a statue of the pair based on a scene from the movie. Befikre is billed as a romantic crime comedy set in Paris and opens on 9 December. Bradford's long association with film was recognised by the UN in 2009 when it became the first city to be named City of Film by Unesco (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization). Analysis: Bradford's Bollywood Background By Shabnam Bashir Mahmood, BBC Asian Network News To have a Bollywood superstar, like Ranveer Singh, visit Bradford is a big deal for fans of Indian cinema in the city. Bradford's love of Bollywood began almost 50 years ago when it became one of the go-to places for screenings for the South Asian immigrant communities. Several cinemas opened specifically showing the all-singing, all-dancing movies that provided escapism for Pakistanis and Indians who'd settled in the UK.  For many it was the only source of entertainment. My dad and his brother were among the first men in Bradford to show these films in the cinema after they had picked up the reels from distributors in London. Sometimes they would play host to one of the many actors of the time like the legendary Waheeda Rahman, Vaijayanti Mala and Helen.

{"article": "Chiltern Edge School in Sonning Common had been rated inadequate by Ofsted after following the inspection in March. Inspectors also said pupil attainment was too low and a disadvantaged pupils' fund was not being used effectively. Oxfordshire County Council said it will begin consulting on Friday over whether the school should shut. The school, which educates children between 11 and 16 years old, received a good rating from Ofsted in 2012. But after the most recent inspection, the watchdog said the school had shown a lack of management and effective teaching, which led to pupils underperforming. It added: \"Standards in reading are too low. Pupils do not read well or widely enough. \"This restricts their access to the wider curriculum.\" The council will discuss the potential closure of the 500-pupil school with parents on 3 May. A spokesman said the consultation - which will run until 16 June - will explore the potential impacts of the closure and how it can provide good-quality education to pupils. Director of children's services Lucy Butler, said: \"It's important to stress at this stage that no decisions have been taken and that the school would not close without appropriate transfer arrangements in place for every child to attend a better-performing school.\" The school would not comment on the potential closure, but a letter to parents read: \"Inevitably, this is a time of great concern and uncertainty for everyone but I assure you that everything possible will be done to safeguard the education and progress of our students.\"", "question": "A @placeholder school placed in special measures by inspectors last month could be closed , a council has said .", "option_0": "major", "option_1": "private", "option_2": "special", "option_3": "secondary", "option_4": "widespread", "label": 3}

{"article": "Dr Dan Poulter, who is still an MP, says medics are \"rightly upset\" about proposed cuts to their pay. He says in an article in The Guardian that the proposed new contract will discourage doctors from seeking careers in areas facing recruitment problems. The Department of Health said his concerns were unfounded. Dr Poulter was a minister at the Department of Health between 2012 and May 2015 and during that time was involved in contract talks with the doctors' union - the British Medical Association. He claims that the proposed new contract which emerged over the summer is very different from what was discussed. A previous recognition that there had to be a better pay and work-life balance, he says, appears to have been lost. The BMA refused to return to the negotiating table this summer because it argued the Government was not open to discussion on certain aspects of the planned new contract. It has said it will organise a ballot of members on industrial action. Junior doctors in England argue that the proposed new contract, to take effect next year, will cut take-home pay by up to 15% and leave them open to excessive working hours which will endanger patient safety. What is the junior doctors row about? Dr Poulter, who worked as a junior doctor in the south of England for 10 years across a range of specialities, agrees. He says the contract the government is threatening to impose \"raises the prospect of 90-hour weeks being written into rotas\" and he adds this is \"impossible to reconcileâ€¦â€¦..with safe patient care\". Ministers say they want to simplify complex arrangements which result in extra payments to reward unsocial hours and weekend working on top of the basic salary. They say that the overall pay bill will not be reduced. The Scottish and Welsh governments have opted not to overhaul junior doctors' contracts. The Department of Health wants the BMA to return to talks. A spokesman said: \"These claims are incorrect. Our proposals will mean average pay will not go down and there is no intention to increase working hours. In fact, we want to offer more safeguards over total hours worked for junior doctors than ever before.

The family's evidence confirmed Ms Mosquito requested to pray with them but they did not, said the PCC. Mr Jamieson said her actions \"clearly interfered with operational policing\".

Whether golfing causes the deformity or not is unclear, they say in the British Journal of Sports Medicine. Almost a fifth of the 2015 Scottish Hydro Challenge players had hip pain. Lead researcher Prof Damian Griffin said shape mismatch between the hips might explain some of the pain reported by the golfers. Dr Andrew Murray, specialist sports doctor for the European golf tour, said: \"Overall, we know golf can provide considerable health benefits, with likely improved longevity, and better physical and mental health. But golf puts huge forces through the hips every time a player swings the club.\" When a golfer takes a swing at the ball, the two hips rotate in different directions and at different speeds. The egg shape seen on some of the scans was visible in 16% of right hips - the rear hip during a swing in a right-handed player - and 4% of left hips - the front hip during the swing in a right-handed player - in the professional golfers. The condition, known as cam rotation, reduces the natural range of movement of the hip.

{"article": "Inzievar Primary in Oakley started up a so-called \"walking bus\" last year. Many schools have schemes like this to promote road safety, health and exercise. But Inzievar, which had relatively high absence levels, tried the idea to see if it might also improve attendance and in turn attainment. The aim is to encourage children to walk to school together. The primary's catchment area - in a village near Dunfermline which once housed many miners - includes places which are classed as disadvantaged. Head teacher Jane Gray said the success of the initiative - which started last autumn - had vastly exceeded her expectations. \"The data tells us we have gone from an average of 25 children arriving late in a day to 10, sometimes less than that,\" she said. \"That's a huge improvement. It's not perfect but it's a huge improvement already.\" She added: \"We had a little boy who was almost never at school and he's here every day. In fact, he's a graduate of the walking bus as he now comes on his scooter.\" Mrs Gray said the initiative had benefited students, parents, teachers and the school's relationship with the local community. She said: \"Teachers can get started in the morning first thing without thinking: am I going to have two or three people coming in late? \"The lollipop lady's happy as she's bringing people across the road in streams rather than in ones and twos. The office staff are delighted as they aren't having to sign so many people in late.\" Three \"buses\" - led by teachers, support staff or parents who have volunteered - now make their way through the village each morning. The way the scheme works is simple. The \"bus\" starts off in a particular place at a certain time. Like a bus, it goes down particular streets at set times and children can join it at their nearest \"stop\". As the \"journey\" goes on, more youngsters join until eventually a big group arrive at school together just before 09:00. Inzievar is expected to benefit from a government scheme to give Â£120m straight to head teachers to help raise attainment. The scheme will give schools across the country around Â£1,200 for each pupil from P1 to S3 known to be eligible for free school meals. However, there are few costs associated with starting a walking bus, other than high-visibility vests for safety and producing maps and timetables. Teachers or other responsible adults need to be available to lead the bus and chaperone the children. One of the pupils who joins the \"bus\" regularly is Liam who uses a wheelchair.

{"article": "The first minister was speaking at Stanford University in California as she continued her five-day US trip. Ms Sturgeon also urged the UK government to recognise the \"right\" of Scots to decide their own future. Opposition parties said she was trying to build support for a referendum which the majority of Scots did not want. The Scottish Parliament last week voted to back the first minister's call for talks to take place with the UK government over a second independence referendum. But the UK government has already declined Ms Sturgeon's request to be given the powers to hold a legally-binding independence referendum before the Brexit process is complete. It has argued that the focus should instead be on getting the best deal for the whole of the UK in the forthcoming negotiations with the EU - with the prime minister repeatedly saying \"now is not the time\" for another vote on independence. Voters in Scotland rejected independence by 55% to 45% in September 2014. Ms Sturgeon used her speech to highlight the global role an independent Scotland could have, stressing it would remain an \"open, outward-looking and inclusive\" nation that would continue to welcome people from across the world. It would also seek to \"build partnerships around the world\", including with governments, businesses and universities, she said. Ms Sturgeon said the Brexit vote in June 2016 posed a \"fundamental question for Scotland\", saying the country now faces an \"exit against our will from the largest trading block in the world, at the hand of a UK government prioritising curbs on immigration above all else\". The alternative to this is independence, with its \"opportunities and challenges\", she said, claiming this would give Scotland \"the freedom to be an equal partner with the other nations of the UK and Europe and with countries across the world\". The first minister added: \"Independence, combined with equal partnership, is the best way for us to build a fairer society at home and to make a positive contribution to the world. \"However that is something which will be debated and discussed across Scotland as we move forward. The immediate point that the UK government must recognise is that the people of Scotland have the right to make that choice.\" The SNP leader accepted some people \"understandably are reluctant\" to hold another vote on the issue so soon after the first one, but also claimed Mrs May's refusal to grant permission for a second referendum was \"not a sustainable position\". She added: \"It is a bit of a holding position just now. There will be another referendum on Scottish independence, of that I am fairly certain.\" While the legislation that created the Scottish Parliament reserved powers over constitutional issues to the UK, Ms Sturgeon argued that \"is quite a vague term\" and said the issue had never been tested in court. The first minister sketched out a political philosophy here which used to be very popular. The vision she described at Stanford University was of an open country which uses the fruits of trade to help everyone in society. The free movement of people and goods was, Nicola Sturgeon claimed, particularly important for a small country like Scotland. But immigration and trade must go hand-in-hand with a more caring economic model, she argued, in a speech which cited as an example \"Rhine Capitalism\", the co-operation between workers, firms and government which produced such remarkable success for the economy of post-war Germany. In essence Ms Sturgeon was arguing that the election of President Trump in the United States and Brexit in Europe were symptoms rather than solutions. The extent to which voters in Scotland agree or disagree with the first minister's assessment and philosophy may play a role in determining whether or not her country eventually becomes independent. The first minister also used the speech to set out her views on the challenges and opportunities of globalisation, migration and climate change. The event, which was billed as discussing Scotland's place in the world, came on the second day of Ms Sturgeon's visit to California. On Monday she signed a climate change agreement with the state's governor, Jerry Brown. Ms Sturgeon is to spend a total of five days in the US, with the aim of \"promoting trade and investment, boosting tourism, sharing best practice across the public and private sector and promoting Scottish innovation and entrepreneurship\". As well as Mr Brown, she has already met senior executives from Apple and Tesla, but will not be meeting anyone from President Donald Trump's administration. She will be in New York on Wednesday, where she will give a speech at the United Nations headquarters, before completing her trip on Friday. Responding to Ms Sturgeon's speech, John Lamont of the Scottish Conservatives said it was a \"great shame that she has chosen to use her taxpayer-funded trip to America to promote independence, and an unwanted referendum.\" He added: \"She may be representing the SNP in doing so - but she does not represent mainstream Scottish opinion.\" Scottish Labour's James Kelly said Ms Sturgeon should use foreign trips to represent the interests of all the people of Scotland, rather than \"trying to build up support for a second referendum that the majority here don't want\".

Workers have had to take pay cuts and reductions in their pensions. Community union said the name showed there was \"the chance of a brighter future for steelmaking in the UK\". A ceremony took place at the site at 11:30 BST to unveil the new British Steel logo. Greybull, the UK-based investment firm, bought the business last month for a nominal Â£1 fee and is to plough up to Â£400m into the plant. Peter Hogg, the commercial director of British Steel, said some customers were \"really, really excited\" by the resurrection of the British Steel brand. He said the pay cut was one in a series of measures that allowed the company to return to profit over the last two months.

On one occasion she had been photographed buying sweets in a village shop. \"If she wants to buy wine gums\", argued the editor of the News of the World, \"she should send a servant to get them\". To which the Queen responded: \"That is an extremely pompous remark.\" A few years later the Privacy Act was introduced but it didn't stop the paparazzi hounding Princess Diana, especially abroad, and, ultimately, their pursuit of her contributed to her untimely death. Against this background, according to royal author Penny Junor, Prince William has become an expert at Privacy Law. He is especially protective of his wife. While she is hailed by some - including veteran Sun royal photographer Arthur Edwards - as \"the New Diana\", that must be exactly what the prince does not want. He does not want Kate to have to suffer the relentless camera intrusion his mother did. When she was still plain Kate Middleton he complained about the intrusion she was getting when she was simply trying to get to work. The couple did not take action against the Australian publication which printed photos of them on honeymoon. Now though, \"a red line has been crossed\" according to Palace officials.

Most recently, Mr Sale drove the campaign to save Bletchley Park, where Colossus aided Allied code-cracking efforts during World War II. At Bletchley he also founded the National Museum of Computing to help preserve the UK's ageing computers. Born in 1931, Mr Sale displayed his talent for engineering at an early age by building a robot, called George I, out of Meccano. One of the later versions of George was built from the remains of a Wellington bomber. Instead of going to university, Mr Sale joined the RAF, which nurtured his engineering talent, and by the age of 20 he was lecturing pilots and aircrew about advances in radar. His career also included a six-year stint as a scientific officer at MI5. He rose to become principal scientific officer of the intelligence agency and aided the work of spycatcher Peter Wright. On leaving MI5 he established, ran and sold a variety of software and engineering firms. During the late 1980s Mr Sale's job at the Science Museum nurtured an interest in old computers. This led to the creation of the Computer Conservation Society which leads efforts to restore many key machines. His interest led to the 14-year project that saw the re-creation of the pioneering Colossus computer. During wartime, Colossus gave the Allies an insight into the communications of the German high command. The rebuilding work was difficult because the original Colossus machines were broken up at the end of WWII and all plans for it were destroyed.

Big hitting Gayle and Marlon Samuels both launched towering straight sixes before both were dismissed by 22-year-old George Dockrell in the 22nd over, the left-arm spinner securing figures of 3-23 at one point.

The income related to Messi's image rights, including contracts with Banco Sabadell, Danone, Adidas, Pepsi-Cola, Procter and Gamble, and the Kuwait Food Company. The footballer and his father are suspected of avoiding paying Spanish tax by using companies in Belize and Uruguay to sell the rights to use Messi's image. The high court in Barcelona said on Wednesday that a decision over whether or not the accused was aware of the fraud scheme should be left for the court hearing. Messi's defence argued that the player had \"never devoted a minute of his life to reading, studying or analysing\" the contracts, El Pais newspaper reports. It follows a similar ruling from a Spanish judge in October last year, when an appeal by the prosecutor to quash the charges against the star striker was thrown out. They had recommended charges be dropped on the grounds that Messi's father was responsible for his finances. Messi and his father made a voluntary €5m \"corrective payment\", equal to the alleged unpaid tax plus interest, in August 2013.

Some demanded President Michel Martelly's resignation for his \"inability to organise elections in the country\". Two opposition activists who had organised the protest were arrested by police for \"public unrest and inciting violence\". Mid-term senate elections in Haiti had been due in May 2012, while the municipal poll is three years behind schedule as Haiti slowly emerges from the earthquake which left much of the country devastated in 2010. In June, President Michel Martelly decreed that the elections be held on 26 October. The date was set after lengthy talks mediated by the president of Haiti's Bishops' Conference, Cardinal Chibly Langlois, intended to overcome the political deadlock between the opposition and the government. But after the National Assembly failed to pass an electoral law in time, the office of Mr Martelly announced another postponement on Sunday. No new date has been set, but the statement said that \"President Michel Martelly, in his constant concern to guarantee political stability, promises to pursue consultations with the different sectors of national life in order to hold the elections as soon as possible\". Opposition politicians accuse President Martelly of wanting to rule by decree - a likely scenario if no elections are held before the lower chamber's term runs out in January. The government argues that opposition politicians are also dragging their feet in the hope of extending their time in office without elections.", "question": "Thousands of Haitians marched in the capital Port-au - Prince on Sunday in protest at a delay in the country 's @placeholder and municipal elections .", "option_0": "local", "option_1": "annual", "option_2": "legislative", "option_3": "municipal", "option_4": "devastating", "label": 2}

The launch of the federal investigation follows protests across the US over the deaths of two other black men. In both cases grand juries decided not to indict white police officers. One of the incidents occurred in New York, where Mayor Bill de Blasio has called for the city to heal after the subsequent fatal shooting of two police officers led to controversy over his role. In Milwaukee, Mr Hamilton's family had reacted with anger to the decision by County District Attorney John Chisholm not to charge Mr Manney, and appealed for peaceful protests. Mr Hamilton was shot after workers at a Starbucks cafe called police to complain about him sleeping in a park. According to Mr Manney, Mr Hamilton resisted arrest when he tried to frisk him, took the officer's baton and hit Mr Manney on the neck with it after the two exchanged punches. Mr Manney then shot him 14 times, saying later that he feared for his safety. Mr Hamilton's family said he had suffered from schizophrenia and had recently stopped taking his medicine. His death triggered a series of protests in Milwaukee and Mr Manney was dismissed over the incident - a decision the former officer has appealed against.

The micro-organic compounds will spend up to two years in space interacting with charred oak in near zero gravity conditions. The results will be compared with a control sample currently maturing on terra firma at Ardbeg's Islay distillery. Dr Bill Lumsden, director of distilling and whisky creation at Ardbeg, said: \"So far so good.

The vials that were launched by Soyuz rocket from Baikanur in Kazakhstan in late 2011 contain a class of chemical compounds known as \"terpenes\". Ardbeg said the experiment could explain the workings of these large, complex molecules and help uncover new information about the change they undergo in a near zero gravity environment.

The idea of a \"five star rating system\" for individuals has also been dropped. This will take the form of \"recommendations\" instead. Co-founder Julia Cordray told the BBC that users of the app will also be able to control which recommendations appear on their profiles. However, in April a premium service called The Truth License will enable those who choose the upgrade to see everything that has been said about other members, whether they have chosen to share those comments or not. It is likely to cost around $1 (Â£0.70) a month, Ms Cordray said. \"We are going to hold everybody accountable to what they say about others,\" she said. The outrage that greeted the unveiling of the app last autumn had taken the firm by surprise, she admitted. It was branded \"creepy\" and \"terrifying\" by some web users. \"We could never have predicted the backlash to the concept,\" she said. \"But it was a positive thing because we ended up being able to give the people what they wanted.\" Despite the media storm 10,000 people volunteered to beta-test it, Ms Cordray added. The team made four main changes to the app's original functions: Additionally, users who are single can opt to grey-out the \"dating\" category so they can neither make nor receive recommendations in that area. Anonymity is not an option, users must use their Facebook log-in to access the app and they can be blocked or reported if they break the rules.

Last month a public inquiry led by Robert Francis published findings into standards of care at Stafford Hospital from 2005-2008. The inquiry led to heavy criticism of the Mid Staffordshire Trust. Nurse Helene Donnelly, who had given evidence to the public inquiry, told the Nursing and Midwifery Council hearing the two senior sisters had changed discharge documents and \"bullied\" other staff to do the same. She said: \"If I or my colleagues refused to change discharge times, Sister[s] Turner and White would shout, cold-shoulder and warn [that] the department could be closed.\" Ms Donnelly said Ms White had also badly treated patients and refused to help undress one elderly patient in A&E, describing her as a \"naughty monkey\". She said Ms White had told one junior doctor not to examine the abdomen of a patient because she needed the bed. Ms Donnelly said she had also witnessed patients being transferred out of A&E in soiled sheets, with dried faeces, at the insistence of sisters White and Turner, to meet a \"four-hour target\".  The hearing was told that failure to treat, discharge or admit patients within that time led to staff being reprimanded by managers. The hearing was told that Ms Turner, who no longer works at the hospital, often swore in front of patients and made comments about their weight. She is also accused of describing one Asian junior doctor as \"Osama's mate\" and asking him if he had a bomb in his rucksack. Ms Donnelly said senior managers must have been aware of changes to records, because of gaps in paperwork. The two senior sister are accused of falsifying hospital data and instructing others to do the same, making inappropriate comments about patients and staff, and transferring patients before they had properly assessed. The pair both deny the allegations, which if upheld could lead to their being struck off.

Her lawyer, Robert Offer, said the decision had been made \"for the health of the family\". It is understood Jolie is seeking physical custody of the couple's six children and asking the judge to give Pitt visitation rights. Speculation is mounting over the causes behind the split, with one newspaper claiming Jolie was \"upset with Pitt's parenting skills\". Ms Jolie's long-time manager Geyser Kosinski told E!

Ferrari's Fernando Alonso crashed on the second lap after breaking his front wing. The Spaniard's team-mate Felipe Massa took fifth, fighting past the Lotus cars of Romain Grosjean and Kimi Raikkonen in the closing laps after the Lotus team's gamble to try to do only three pit stops rather than four failed. Grosjean finished sixth ahead of Raikkonen, who won the first race in Australia last weekend. McLaren's Jenson Button was on for a points-scoring finish, possibly in fifth place, before he was sent on his way from a pit stop with a loose front wheel. The Sauber of Nico Hulkenberg took eighth ahead of McLaren's Sergio Perez, with Toro Rosso's Jean-Eric Vergne 10th. It was a race full of drama as the intra-team battles at Red Bull and Mercedes played out live. \"The Malaysian Grand Prix team orders controversy at Red Bull is only the latest episode of a long-running drama between Sebastian Vettel and Mark Webber. \"It goes right back to 2010, when the two crashed while Vettel tried to pass Webber for the lead of the Turkish Grand Prix. \"Since then, there has been a litany of further incidents at the team as the two men, both intensely determined and tough but very different in other ways, have battled for supremacy. \"Adding spice to it is Webber's belief that, while they profess to allow them to battle it out on the track, the team is more behind Vettel than him. \"The belief - widely shared within F1 - is founded on the way the team have responded to the various situations between their drivers. \"In their battle in Malaysia there may even have been a bit of residual revenge on Vettel's part - the German and his champion at Red Bull, motorsport chief Helmet Marko, felt Webber was obstructive in last season's title-deciding Brazilian Grand Prix.\" The battle between the Red Bulls was resolved in an intense scrap as Webber rejoined from his final pit stop. Vettel was warned by team boss Christian Horner that he was being \"silly\" but the two then battled wheel-to-wheel around Turns One and Two onto Turn Four, where Webber appeared finally to yield to his team-mate despite having the inside line. Webber said: \"After the last stop the team told me the race was over and we turned the engines down and go to the end. The team made their decision. Seb made his own decision and he will have protection as usual.\" Vettel was told over the radio after the race: \"Good job, Seb. Looks like you wanted it bad enough. Still you've got some explaining to do.\" Webber had initially taken the lead at the first stops as the drivers came in to fit dry-weather tyres following a wet start. He had led the race throughout, with the two Red Bull drivers using the two available tyre compounds in different orders. Vettel chose to end the race on the softer 'medium' tyre while Webber was on the hard. Vettel said: \"Obviously it is very hot and if there is something to say we need to say it internally.\" Red Bull motorsport chief Helmut Marko, a powerful champion of Vettel, admitted the battle had \"got out of control\". Meanwhile, there was controversy at Mercedes as Rosberg followed Hamilton closely in the final laps. Media playback is not supported on this device Rosberg asked the team to let him pass Hamilton, but was told \"negative\" by team boss Ross Brawn. When he complained again, Brawn told him that Hamilton - who had earlier been told to save fuel - was also being \"controlled\" and could also go faster. Hamilton admitted on the podium: \"I can't say it's the best feeling being up here today. If I'm honest I really feel Nico should be standing here.\" Hamilton had provided an amusing diversion when, coming in for his second stop, he headed into the pit box of former team McLaren before being waved on towards Mercedes. \"I did a Jenson,\" he said. \"He did it a couple of years ago and I've done it today. Apologies to my team.\" The result puts Vettel into the championship lead by 11 points from Raikkonen. Webber is five points further adrift and ahead of Hamilton, Massa and Alonso, who is already 22 points behind Vettel, the man who narrowly beat him to the title 2010 and 2012. Alonso started third and was up to second, past Massa, by the first corner. But he tapped the back of Vettel's car in Turn Two. It was the lightest of touches but enough to break the front wing mounts. He held onto second place throughout the first lap but did not stop to change it and it collapsed heading into Turn One on the second lap, sending him into the gravel trap. Ferrari said the decision not to stop was made in the pits. Alonso wrote later on Twitter: \"Bad luck today. As always over 19 races we will be compensated and we are ready to recover good points in the next race.\" Result: 1. Sebastian Vettel (Ger), Red Bull, 1hr 38min 56.681secs 2.

It has replaced the swing, which was being sold less, particularly during the winter, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. The price movements of 700 goods and services are measured in 20,000 UK outlets to calculate inflation. Also added to the basket were gin, flavoured ciders, non-dairy milk (such as soya or almond), men's fitness tops, and jigsaw puzzles for adults. Gin comes back into the mix after a 13-year absence from the basket - the result of new craft distilleries popping up and rising popularity. Bicycle helmets also return to the inflation basket after a 12-year absence. Disappearing from the basket are alcopops, old mobile phone handsets, menthol cigarettes, and the fee for stopping cheques. The basket of goods reflects contemporary habits and technology to calculate the changing cost of living, as measured by the inflation rate. A series of changes have been made, but the replacement of the swing with the scooter is perhaps the clearest signal of how families have changed their habits regarding gifts for children. Officials at the ONS have decided scooters have moved on from being a fad to become everyday items. Last year, coffee pods and microwave rice were added to the basket, to reflect a long-term trend towards prepared foods. Nightclub entry fees and rewriteable DVDs were among the items removed from the calculations. Hello I'm an experiment from BBC News Labs. You can ask me questions about this story, like...

{"article": "Tory peer Lord Ballyedmond, 70, died when the helicopter came down near the estate he owned in Gillingham, Norfolk. Pilot Capt Carl Dickerson, 36, co-pilot Capt Lee Hoyle, 45, and foreman Declan Small, 42, also died in the 2014 crash. The inquest heard the fog was so thick RAF rescue crews could not land. Mr Dickerson had warned the peer, also known as Dr Edward Haughey, the helicopter needed to take off \"no later than 7pm\" because of bad weather. It did not in fact take off until 19:22 GMT as Dr Haughey oversaw renovations of Gillingham Hall, including selecting paint colours, decorator John Savage told the hearing. Flt Lt Ian Smith, an on-call RAF search and rescue pilot at Wattisham airfield, Suffolk, told a jury inquest in Norwich that he was sent to the scene of the crash. But even with night-vision goggles, radar and military training, his helicopter was unable to land because of low visibility, he said. He added: \"It was thick fog, we couldn't see anything below us.\" Barry Dolby, who was working at the house, watched the helicopter take off. He said: \"I could not believe they took off in that fog. \"I've worked on oil rigs and any time there was a sign of fog we would be stuck until it cleared.\" Painter-decorator John Savage, from Newry, County Down, said that at 19:15 GMT Mr Hoyle said: \"We have to go now or we will be grounded.\" He said Dr Haughey then left, although Mr Hoyle did not seem \"stressed or concerned\". Plasterer Robert Graham said: \"They said they needed to take off by 7pm or air traffic control would not let them fly because of the fog. \"They kept checking their watches.\" Dr Haughey, 70, who lived at Ballyedmond Castle in Co Down, Northern Ireland, had an estimated wealth in excess of Â£800m. Best known as chairman and founder of Norbrook Laboratories, the largest privately-owned pharmaceutical company in the world, father-of-three Dr Haughey had a range of other business interests. An Air Accidents Investigation Branch report has already found the crash may have been triggered by an error in perception along with a lack of training and procedures.

{"article": "Ronny Kynes and David Williams scored two tries apiece for the Steelmen, who had lost to Pontypridd in last season's final. Bradley Coombes and Seb Davies scored tries for Pontypridd in between Dan Haymond crossing for Ebbw Vale's fifth try. Vale's first title denied Pontypridd a fifth successive success.

Coombes' try was Pontypridd's first points of the game but Haymond ran 80 metres to score a fifth try for Ebbw Vale, which Langdon converted.
