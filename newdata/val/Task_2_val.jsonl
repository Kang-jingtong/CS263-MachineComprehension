{"article": "Devil populations have been decimated by a highly contagious facial cancer that is transferred when these aggressive animals bite each other. The findings will help researchers select the best individuals to be kept in captivity for eventual re-release. The research is outlined in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The Tasmanian devil, Sarcophilus harrisii, gets its name from its high-pitch, blood-curdling squeal, and is renowned for fighting over access to animal carcases, which it grinds with the bone-crushing force of its jaws. In 1996, a wildlife photographer snapped an image of an animal in the far north-east of Tasmania with a peculiar growth on its face. The growth, it turned out, was neither benign, nor isolated to this one individual, but was a highly contagious, fatal cancer that seemed to be spreading through the population at lightning speed. By 2007, conservationists reported that Devil Facial Tumour Disease, DFTD, had wiped out more than 90% of devil populations in the north-east of Tasmania, and was spreading west. A strategy to save the devil from extinction was begun. Now, an international team of genomicists is offering a helping hand. The researchers took advantage of the latest technology to read the genetic sequence of two devils - an uninfected male called Cedric, and an infected female called Spirit -  along with smaller segments of DNA from 175 other individuals. The team hopes to use the genomes to pinpoint which individuals should be placed into \"protective custody\" to wait out the cancerous epidemic before being reintroduced. From their analysis, the scientists predicted how best to capture as much genetic diversity among the individuals put aside for captive breeding, explained lead author Webb Miller, a genomicist from Pennsylvania State University, US. He said that choosing individuals who were very genetically dissimilar should take priority over whether they were resistant to the cancer. \"It is a big step forward to actually get the genome sequence from this animal... the [world's largest] remaining carnivorous marsupial,\" said zoologist David Rollinson from the Natural History Museum, UK. Getting two complete genomes was very valuable, said Dr Rollinson, but getting as many samples as they did, from as many different animals was \"just the icing on the cake\". Dr Rollinson thinks that a similar approach could be used to study and save other endangered animals. The researchers also sequenced one of the five tumours from Spirit's head for clues to why the Tasmanian devils fail to recognise the cancer as \"non-self\", and destroy it before it takes hold. Understanding what it is about the devil's immune system that makes it so ineffectual at picking up the facial cancer will not only help treat those already infected, but will hold clues about whether the cancer can jump species. \"The greatest worry is that it will jump into another marsupial,\" said cancer geneticist Elizabeth Murchison from the Welcome Trust Sanger Institute in Hinxton, UK.", "question": "Scientists have sequenced the complete genomes of two Tasmanian devils in the hope of finding clues to @placeholder this highly endangered marsupial .", "option_0": "predict", "option_1": "treat", "option_2": "investigate", "option_3": "avoid", "option_4": "preserving", "label": 4}
{"article": "A penalty try and scores from Alex Goode and Chris Wyles gave Sarries a 24-3 lead at half-time. The bonus point was wrapped up four minutes after the break as Maro Itoje crossed, shortly before Richard Wigglesworth touched down. Arthur Aziza went over for Oyonnax but Schalk Brits was awarded a late effort to complete the rout for Saracens. Aziza's try was a deserved consolation for the French side, who were committed and spirited in their first ever home game in the Champions Cup, but were outclassed by a Saracens team that sits nine points clear at the top of Pool One. The Premiership leaders dominated the scrum, until the introduction of a series of replacements in the second half upset their rhythm, and attacked with speed and purpose to signal their credentials as title candidates. New England head coach Eddie Jones will name his first squad next month, and there were plenty of performances from Saracens' English contingent that would have caught the attention of the Australian. But it was Farrell who stood out with creativity and quickness that belied his reputation as a defensive, pragmatic fly-half. The England number 10 crashed through a gap in the Oyonnax rearguard before swinging a looping pass out wide to Wyles, who slipped in Goode for the visitors' second try. And Farrell was central to the next score, popping up an offload from the ground to allow Will Fraser to find the on-rushing Wyles on his way to touching down under the posts. In fact, it may be 26-year-old Fraser who gave Jones the most to think about after this display. The uncapped open-side flanker was impressive with the ball in hand and could provide competition for the England number seven shirt, particularly with the future of England captain Chris Robshaw under scrutiny. Saracens can take a step closer to progressing when they host Oyonnax in the reverse fixture next weekend. Saracens full-back Alex Goode said: \"We are really coming alive when we get the ball in good positions at the moment. \"We are using our strike runners very well. We are getting them in the game and we are picking them out. \"Guys like Chris Ashton are doing brilliantly in terms of the support lines they are running. \"We have had a young team over the last few years and we have grown together and added layers to our game. \"We have been close in this tournament before, we have our foundations, we are in a good place but we know there is a long journey ahead yet.\" TEAMS Oyonnax: Etienne; Tian, Bousses, Taufa, Codjo; Clegg, Cibray; Tonga'uiha, Maurouard, Pungea; Power, Fabbri; Ursache, Missoup, Wannenburg.

{"article": "The biennial event is where the world's aerospace and defence (A&D) companies come to talk - and do - business. And, in an industry where cross-border co-operation is vital, much of that talk was forecast to focus on the dire consequences for British A&D in a post-referendum world. Yet, this being Britain, it's the weather that seems to be the main topic on everyone's lips. Evidence of serious concern about Brexit at this international gathering of executives and military top brass was thin on the ground (publicly, at least). Take comments from the Pentagon's chief buyer of weapons, US Defense Under Secretary Frank Kendall. \"I don't see any reason why it should fundamentally affect our relationship with the UK or our business deals with the UK,\" he said. UK and US defence interests are inextricably linked. BAE Systems, the UK's largest arms manufacturer, has a big presence in the US and is a key contractor on the world's most expensive defence programme, the US-led F-35 Joint Strike Fighter project. BAE is also lead contractor on the Eurofighter Typhoon programme, a pan-European project involving defence giants across the continent. Does Brexit put these in doubt? \"I personally don't think it does,\" Ian King, BAE System's chief executive, told the BBC. \"We don't trade with the EU as a defence entity, it's with individual nations.\" He says that the quality of UK technology and capabilities will always be in demand internationally, especially given that defence and security have risen rapidly up the political agenda. BAE had backed continued EU membership. \"It was right for the UK to stay part of a coherent trading bloc,\" he said. And he still wants to see a trade deal done that involves the free movement of capital and people. But now that the British people have spoken, the strategy is to see what can be done \"to maintain that continuity in a different form\". That's the view among British A&D companies generally. The overwhelming majority of firms wanted to Remain, according to a survey conducted before the referendum by ADS Group, the industry's trade body. They cited access to the European supply chain, skills, and R&D funding among the key benefits. All that is history, though. The challenge now, according to ADS chief executive Paul Everitt, is to achieve continuity - and ram home the message that the UK is open for business. \"We are the largest aerospace and defence market in Europe,\" he said. \"The government needs to send a strong signal about the attractiveness of the business environment here.\" Prime Minister David Cameron tried to do exactly that at the start of the show, in what looked like a carefully choreographed announcement about Boeing's commitment to the UK. The UK government is buying nine Boeing maritime patrol aircraft as part of a Â£3bn, 10-year partnership that involves generating 2,000 jobs. Boeing will also deliver 50 Apache attack helicopters to the British Army. \"Whatever uncertainties our country faces, I want the message to go out loud and clear: the UK will continue to lead the world in both civil and defence aerospace,\" Mr Cameron said. \"We aren't just open for investment, we are a place the global aerospace industry wants to do business - as Boeing's long-term partnership with the UK proves.\" Boeing's chairman Dennis Muilenburg duly reciprocated. \"Boeing is committed to the UK government's prosperity agenda and we share the goals of enhanced economic growth that the prime minister has set,\" he said. Boeing has doubled its presence in the UK over the past five years, and \"we don't really see our plans changing,\" Mr Muilenburg added. There was a similar message from Raytheon International, the US missiles and electronics company which has a big UK presence. Its chief executive, John Harris, called Brexit a \"long play\". He told the BBC: \"We do not see any immediate impact... The process will take years once Article 50 is filed.\" Raytheon would adapt to market changes, he said. But the critical issue \"is to ensure we remain a trusted partner of the UK government\". Among major European companies, too, pre-referendum worries are giving way to post-referendum pragmatism. \"We are where we are,\" said one executive, who had previously privately warned that a Leave vote would be \"economic stupidity\". \"Aerospace is a long-term game. If - and I stress 'if' - there are strategic changes, they will be a long way down the road,\" he said. Mauro Moretti, chief executive of Italy's Leonardo - formerly Finmeccanica - was especially upbeat about his company's UK operations, which include AgustaWestland helicopters. He said: \"We would like to invest [in the UK]. We have in the UK very important facilities. We have a very highly-skilled workforce. \"We would like to maintain our presence - to increase our presence,\" he added. Yet, as the marketing manager of one small UK aerospace supplier pointed out: \"It's easier to maintain trade if you are a big defence contractor dealing with governments. It's going to be more difficult if you are further down the supply chain.\" He didn't want to be named - \"it's not in my commercial interest\" - but his company supplies equipment that ends up on both Airbus and Boeing aircraft. \"I think the uncertainty that is created by leaving the EU is magnified if you are a smaller player in this industry,\" he said. The message from the Brexiteers is that business will soon be unshackled from EU regulations that hindered the pursuit of more opportunities in the wider world. At Farnborough, with its 1,500 exhibitors and 100,000 trade visitors, companies from all corners of the world are touting for business and doing deals. Among these is China, which has its biggest ever presence at the air show. With its huge aerospace and airline ambitions, China wants to do more business with Britain, says Xu Jin, a minister at the Chinese embassy in London. \"The British should not worry about China not being your friend after Brexit,\" he told a conference on aerospace opportunities in his country. So, China won't desert Britain when it leaves the EU? \"Never. This is never going to happen. China is always going to be your friend.\" Another international perspective came from Akbar Al Baker, chief executive of one of aviation's major players, Qatar Airways. As a big purchaser of Airbus aircraft (whose wings are made in the UK) and a 15% shareholder in IAG, owner of British Airways and Iberia (whose shares tanked after the Brexit vote), Qatar Airways is no mere outside observer. But Mr Al Baker says that the \"caution\" around Brexit can be overdone. \"I'm sure that stable minds in the political arena will prevail. And they will realise that regardless of whether Britain stays in the EU, they will still need each other.\" He can't understand why such a momentous move was decided on a simple majority at the ballot box, rather than, say, 75%. But in the end, common sense will prevail, he believes. \"Trade both ways is massive. They both need each other. At the end of the day, you are all Europeans.\"", "question": "Brexit was supposed to cast storm clouds over this week 's Farnborough Airshow .

{"article": "Thousands of men then climbed on to what was known as no man's land. This was the first day of the Somme -  one of the deadliest battles of World War One. Thousands of soldiers died in a very short amount of time. In total, more than one million soldiers were killed or wounded on both sides of the fight. The people in charge said that the battle had to happen to win the war, but even now people can't agree on whether it was the right decision or a huge mistake. On 4 August 1914, Britain declared war on Germany. It became known as \"The Great War\" because it affected people all over the world and was the biggest war anyone had ever known. The war was fought between two powerful groups - the Allied Powers, which Britain and France were part of, and the Central Powers, led by Germany with Austria-Hungary. Guide: World War One A lot of the fighting took place along the Western Front where the soldiers had dug out special ditches called trenches. The two sets of trenches faced each other across an area called no man's land. The soldiers lived in the trenches and mounted attacks using things like rifles, machine guns and poison gas. The aim of the Allied attacks were to break through the enemy's trenches and push the German Army back towards the centre of Europe. Breaking through the trenches wasn't easy. So the British and French planned a really big attack that became known as the Battle of the Somme. To weaken the German defences, the Allied forces fired shells from artillery guns. The shelling, called a bombardment, went on for a whole week. When it had finished, the British and French soldiers came out of their trenches and headed towards the German lines. They weren't expecting much of a fight because everyone thought that the shells would have killed the German soldiers. But there was a problem. When the shelling started the Germans hid in special shelters called dug-outs. They waited underground for a week and when the shelling finished they came out and fired machine guns at the advancing Allied troops. The British troops were caught in no man's land and couldn't hide from the German bullets. Many soldiers lost their lives. The fighting started on 1 July 1916. Because it's called a battle you might imagine that it all happened in a few days, but it actually went on for months and finally finished in November 1916. The battle was between the German Army on one side and the British and French on the other. The German Army was thought to be a better fighting force because more of its soldiers had been given full training. They were mostly professional soldiers and trained reservists. The British Army also had professional soldiers but it was mostly made up of volunteers. It was the start of the war so the soldiers who died were those who had been first to volunteer. The British often fought in groups nicknamed Pals Battalions, where everyone in the battalion came from the same towns and villages. More than one million soldiers were killed or wounded in the Battle of the Somme. On the first day of the battle, nearly 20,000 British soldiers were killed, another 40,000 were injured. This was the biggest single loss of life in the history of the British Army. The fighting continued over the next five months and by the end of the battle about 420,000 British soldiers had died. The British and French troops made only a small advance into the German-held areas. Because of this, many people saw it as a failure and thought that General Haig, who was in charge of the British Army, had not done a good job. Most people who study this part of history do agree that the Battle of the Somme drained the German Army and this was an important first step towards the Allied victory in 1918.

{"article": "The DeirEzzor24 website reported that an unidentified jet had dropped cluster bombs on Dablan, about 20km (13 miles) south-east of the town of Mayadin. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights put the death toll at 30. It comes only two days after a US-led coalition strike reportedly killed 42 detainees at an IS prison near Mayadin. The coalition confirmed it had targeted \"IS command-and-control elements\" in the area on Monday, but said the raid had been \"meticulously planned\" to avoid harming civilians. There was no immediate comment from the coalition on Wednesday's reported attack. The Russian and Syrian air forces also fly sorties in the region. At the start of June, the coalition said its 21,035 air strikes in Syria and Iraq since 2014 had unintentionally killed at least 484 civilians. However, human rights groups believe the true figure is far higher. Airwars, an organisation that tracks allegations of civilian deaths, said that as of 8 June, the coalition had killed at least 4,118 civilians and perhaps more than 16,000. DeirEzzor24 said the house of a person not connected to IS appeared to have been targeted, and that several nearby buildings had also been destroyed. Women and children were among those killed, it added, warning that the death toll was likely to rise because of the serious condition of some of the injured. Mayadin, which lies in the Euphrates river valley about 45km (28 miles) south-east of the city of Deir al-Zour, has been targeted frequently by coalition aircraft. US intelligence officials believe IS moved most of its leaders to the town in recent months as Iraqi government forces advanced into the Iraqi city of Mosul and a US-backed alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters encircled the Syrian city of Raqqa.

{"article": "It is a well-thumbed copy of Catch 22, Joseph Heller's classic satirical novel on the absurdities of war; not an inappropriate choice for somebody who's spent her entire life amid one of the Middle East's most intractable conflicts. But Rawan's life is about to take a different direction. Currently a student at Gaza's Islamic University, she has just won a scholarship to Oxford University to study linguistics and Italian. She is looking forward to moving from the minarets of Gaza to the city of \"dreaming spires\". \"I'm very excited. I can't wait,\" she smiles. \"It's going to be different but it's going to be fun.\" Few have made such a journey. But what is even more unusual is that all the other students at Oxford's Jesus College will pay some of the cost of Rawan's studies. As part of the recently established Jesus College Junior Members Scholarship most of the other students have each agreed to pay Â£3.90 ($5.90) per term towards Rawan's fees. The scholarship was set up by Oxford graduate Emily Dreyfus after she realised that few Gazans had ever had the chance to study at one of Britain's most prestigious universities. She says most other students at Jesus were happy to contribute. \"They voted for this from the outset. They recognise that this is a very small contribution to make which has a disproportionately positive benefit.\" The student contributions will raise around Â£6,300 a year towards Rawan's living costs. This is only a fraction of the estimated Â£30,000 annual costs needed to complete the four-year course. But the university has agreed to waive around 60% of the tuition fees. The rest of the costs are being paid for by three charities: The Hani Qaddumi Scholarship Foundation, the AM Qattan Foundation and the Hoping Foundation which supports Palestinian refugees around the world. Rawan still had to apply for and win the place against fierce competition, but she knows the other students at Jesus have given her a rare opportunity. \"I really appreciate that Emily believed in people here and she gave somebody like me a life changing chance,\" she says. Rawan has only once before left the tiny Palestinian territory, when she went on a study trip to the United States. Israel's blockade of Gaza and the ongoing conflict with Hamas which governs here make it difficult for Palestinians to leave through Israel. In the past, Israel has refused permission for Palestinian students to leave Gaza in order to carry out studies abroad. It is likely Rawan will leave Gaza through Egypt in order to travel to Oxford. She is currently completing a degree in English literature studying, among other books, George Orwell's Animal Farm and William Golding's Lord of the Flies. She says her favourite book is Mornings In Jenin by the Palestinian American writer Susan AbulHawa. The novel follows the story of three generations of a Palestinian family who became refugees after the creation of the state of Israel in 1948. Rawan is also a fan of JK Rowling, author of the Harry Potter books. \"Her style of writing is very subtle. There are little things in her stories that grab your attention.\" Education is highly valued in Gaza. There are no fewer than seven universities in the territory for a population of 1.7 million people. But Rawan is expecting a different study experience at Oxford. \"The education system is completely different. I'm going to have my own tutors not like in Gaza where I am among hundreds of students who have the same teacher.\" She will also have to get used to mixed education.

{"article": "A celebrity jumping into a car and singing with James Corden has been a staple of The Late Late Show since he took over as host in March 2015. But now it's becoming a TV series in its own right, with new episodes released every week on Apple Music. The first proper trailer gives us a little taste of what to expect from the 16-episode run. 1. Carpool Karaoke no longer needs to be in a car. Or even on the ground Carpool Karaoke is no longer confined by silly little details like, you know, actually being in a car. \"This is the next level,\" says Will Smith, as he guides James Corden towards a waiting helicopter at one point in the trailer. Gravity schmavity. Appropriately, the first song they sing once they are in said aircraft is, of course, R Kelly's I Believe I Can Fly. Reports that they also belted out a rendition of Westlife's Flying Without Wings could not be immediately confirmed. 2. Ariana Grande and Seth MacFarlane have zero time for parking restrictions At one point, Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane and singer and all-round awesome person Ariana Grande are shown standing by the parked car. Earlier in the trailer, they had been seen beautifully singing a song from The Little Shop of Horrors. All sweet and innocent and lovely. But look a little closer - and the plot takes a much darker turn. They appear to have pulled up across TWO disabled parking spaces. Ariana is going to have to give us at least six new masterpieces of Side To Side-level quality to redeem herself. 3. It's strange not having James Corden in the driver's seat Since the dawn of time, James Corden has been a ubiquitous presence in the driver's seat of the Carpool Karaoke automobile. Which is fair enough, since he basically came up with the idea when he first climbed into a car with George Michael for Comic Relief in 2011. But he's now allowed someone else to get behind the wheel, which gives us the extremely exciting prospect of episodes with five-piece bands. Or in this case, four-piece bands, plus a guest. The previous application form was limited to a maximum of four people, which gave us the gift of Carpools featuring Red Hot Chili Peppers and One Direction 2.0. But behold, now we have comedian Billy Eichner hitching a ride with Metallica. We're trying not to get our hopes up but this could technically pave the way for Little Mix giving Ozzy Osbourne a lift to the supermarket. 4. They may need a bigger car \"You're going to need a bigger boat,\" said someone once, in some famous movie or other. In this case, the production team are perhaps going to need a bigger car for two of their more well-built guests. Basketball player Shaquille O'Neal and wrestler John Cena just about managed to squeeze in. We're just relieved it wasn't a Mini. 5. A lot of people mistake John Legend for Pharrell Williams John Legend takes Alicia Keys and Hidden Figures actress Taraji P. Henson on a little spin in the new Carpool series, with the two singers seen belting out Alicia's Fallin'. (Tune). But they also have a nice little chat, during which John Legend reveals that despite being an Actual Legend, people often mistake him for somebody else. \"Old white women think I'm Pharrell [Williams] sometimes,\" he explains. He even briefly belts out the hook of Happy so as not to disappoint this particular fanbase. 6. Blake Shelton and Chelsea Handler are keen to get their five a day A slice of orange, a chunk of pineapple, a quarter of lime - it's fair to say country singer Blake Shelton and comic Chelsea Handler are fans of fruit. Alternatively, it's possible that they're fans of alcohol, which is very often served with fruit. Or they could be auditioning to become the faces of a new fruit and veg campaign, judging by this segment in the trailer. What do you mean a slice of lemon in your drink doesn't count towards your five a day? Why would you ruin this perfectly nice afternoon? 7. Wait. Go back a sec. Is that... a BRASS BAND? Yep. That's a 90-piece brass band. Being conducted from a sun roof by Will Smith. Who is leading them in a rendition of his 1997 treasure Gettin' Jiggy Wit It. I need to lie down. 8. Heavy metal sounds better in the dairy aisle First Blake and Chelsea hit the pub, and look, there's John Legend and Alicia Keys in a laundrette. Straight in at number one in the Look We Can Be Normal chart, however, is Metallica in a supermarket. If you haven't experienced Enter Sandman being performed next to the free range eggs, you've not heard Mozart the way it was meant to be played.

{"article": "Media playback is not supported on this device When Liverpool host Wolves in the FA Cup fourth round, it will be over two years since boyhood Reds fan Coady, now 23, was allowed to leave the club. And he is intent only on helping his side become the third in a week to win at Anfield. \"We're going there to win and hopefully take the game to them,\" he told BBC WM. Coady never got to play a home game in his three years at Anfield, with both his first-team appearances coming on the road, the second as a late sub for Philippe Coutinho in a 3-1 win at Fulham, his only one in the Premier League. After a season-long loan with Sheffield United, he eventually moved on to Huddersfield Town in August 2014 and then Wolves a year later. But Coady knows, from his experience watching the Reds as a boy, that Liverpool do not have many slumps of the current magnitude and Wolves might have timed their trip to Anfield just right. \"We've got a great chance the way Liverpool are playing,\" he said. \"They're a top team but they've had quite a lot of games.\" Since Wolves won 2-0 in the third round at Stoke on 7 January, Paul Lambert's men have only played twice, while Liverpool have been in action six times. Of those six games, they have won only once - the FA Cup third-round replay at League Two side Plymouth - have failed to score in three of them and have lost their last two at home. Following the shock home defeat by Swansea City which damaged their Premier League title hopes, Wednesday's League Cup semi-final exit to Southampton has cast a cloud over Anfield. \"We've got to take that into account,\" said Coady. \"We've got go there on the front foot, try to stop them playing, hopefully nick the ball and see if we can get something out of it.\" And what if Coady himself were to find the net? \"It would be what dreams are made of,\" he grinned. \"I'm not one of those who wouldn't celebrate. I'd go ballistic to score for this club. It doesn't happen very often.\" Wolves boss Lambert knows what it takes to win at Anfield. His Aston Villa side did so in December 2012, and Wolves loan signing Andreas Weimann was one of the Villa scorers that day in a 3-1 victory. So can he do it again? Fourth in the Premier League v 18th in the Championship? \"We're up against an iconic club, and we're going to have to handle the atmosphere and the crowd, but I'd be disappointed if we couldn't handle the occasion,\" Lambert told BBC WM. \"If we can do that, we can win the game. And I believe in them. Mentally, they're ready for it. They'll handle it.\" Lambert is keenly awaiting his reunion with Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp, who he first met when they did the Pro Licence coaching course together in Germany in 2004. He was playing for Celtic by then, long after he had helped Borussia Dortmund win the European Cup in 1997 and four years before Klopp took over as Dortmund boss in 2008. \"He was also at a club I was fortunate to play for,\" said Lambert. \"There were connections between us and he went on to bring Dortmund back to where they should have been - two league titles, two cups and a kick away from winning the Champions League. \"He is a big character and a really top guy.

{"article": "There are special effects and stunt doubles all right. But the ageing hero fishes a gun quicker than you can say Kabali; smashes furniture and sends villains flying across the air with lethal kicks, gives chase and hunts down the baddies with characteristic flair. The thalaivar (the boss, as his fans call him) shows no signs of slowing down. The 150-film veteran even gives chase to the villain, played by Taiwanese actor Winston Chao, against the Petronas Towers, one of the world's tallest buildings, in Malaysia. Kabali has all the ingredients of a Rajinikanth entertainer: heroics, smoking guns, bloody fight sequences, Malay and Tamil hip hop and rap music, lots of Tamil regional pride and romance. It also has the angry superstar delivering truisms in his trademark mocking style. How Rajinikanth and Kabali mania swept India Sporting a grey beard, Rajinikanth plays Kabali, a rubber plantation worker who walks out of prison in Malaysia after a 25-year term. He then turns against a group of gangsters who framed him to put him in prison in the first place. Kabali battles the group, led by Chao, who plays a drug lord, and Tamil gangsters who run drug and prostitution rackets in the country. He speaks for the rights of the Tamil migrants in Malaysia. He sets up a foundation to offer education and livelihood for the Tamil youth. His love interest is his strong and independent wife, played by the talented Bollywood actress Radhika Apte. Director Pa Ranjith gets Rajinikanth to address issues of caste, class and race: the superstar is shown reading an English book written by a Dalit (formerly known as untouchables) writer; and he is attired in tuxedos and suits, a nod to the western sartorial style of Dalit icon BR Ambedkar. \"Black is power\", states Kabali with characteristic swag in the film. \"The dark-skinned Tamil is equal to all races; he is no longer a slave in the plantations of Malaysia but one who asks for equal opportunities with education and hard work.\" But all critics are not impressed. There is very little in Kabali, says one, which sets it apart in tone and tenor from the star's recent outings. And the pace does slacken a little, and sometimes the actor actually looks tired. \"Rajinikanth's achievement, as always, is that he manages to hold the audience in thrall even when the film threatens to flag - this despite the fact that he is only peddling time-worn tricks,\" writes Saibal Chatterjee. But fans are flocking to the film, and Kabali appears to be on its way to becoming another box office hit for the superstar. Even before its release - the film has been dubbed in Telugu, Hindi, Malay and Mandarin - it had mopped up $30m (Â£20m) in rights sales. Because, in the end, Rajinikanth remains a larger-than-life superstar and a one-man cult. \"A lot of fans refer to him as God, or as someone who is beyond human desires. So many fans treat the star in ways that are not unlike how people in India treat gurus or spiritual leaders,\" says Rinku Kalsy, who made a documentary on his fans.", "question": "At 65 , Tamil cinema superstar and a grandfather in real life , Rajinikanth , packs a mean punch in his new film Kabali , an action - packed gangster drama , which @placeholder on Friday .", "option_0": "group", "option_1": "overturned", "option_2": "opened", "option_3": "rely", "option_4": "debuts", "label": 2}

{"article": "At the Democrats Abroad watch party in downtown Toronto, the faces were glum. Eric Mintz, a statistician, realised earlier than some that pollsters missed the significance of Donald Trump support, and that the Republican looked likely to clinch the win. He described the atmosphere as \"slowly descending into gloom\". \"It's an extinction moment - he's an extinction candidate,\" Mr Mintz said, saying he feared that America as it exists now will come to an end. \"I think he's extraordinarily dangerous in policy and personality.\" Canada's immigration website crashes A few blocks away at the swanky Albany Club, a well-heeled crowd of politicians, diplomats and businesspeople were watching with disbelief as the results rolled in. Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne had backed Democratic US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, but her concern was rooted in more than just politics. \"Our fate is absolutely inextricably linked to the United States,\" the premier of Canada's most populous province told the BBC. \"If we have a partner south of the border that isn't interested in getting a softwood lumber deal or making sure we continue our relationship with the auto sector, that's very, very bad for the province and it's bad for the country.\" Her number one issue in the Canada-US relationship? \"Trade.\" Canada and the US share the longest peaceful border on Earth. Canada's economy, based largely on foreign trade, is tied to that of the US. America is by far the country's largest trading partner, with some CA$2.3bn ($1.7 bn/Â£1.4bn)  in goods and services crossing the Canada-US border daily. So how Mr Trump handles trade, especially the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), matters to Canada.  He has called the agreement  a \"disaster\" and has vowed to either renegotiate it or axe it completely. Mr Trump has also said he would pressure allies to pay their fair share into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (Nato). Nato guidelines say member states should spend at least 2% of their gross domestic product on defence. Most countries in the military alliance, including Canada, lag behind on that figure. Canada also shares close ties with the US when it comes to tackling shared national security concerns, climate change, and the war against so-called Islamic State. But Mr Trump is a possible ally on one file: the Keystone XL pipeline, which the Obama administration rejected in 2015. The company behind the controversial Alberta-to-Texas pipeline says it is still committed to the project. Canada had lined up largely behind Clinton. Not everyone though. David Woolley, 26, a communications professional, was proudly sporting a Make America Great Again baseball cap. Once a supporter of Mrs Clinton's primary rival Bernie Sanders, Mr Woolley gravitated towards Trump. He said the real estate mogul held positions similar to Mr Sanders, such as curbing free trade and limiting American interventions abroad. \"We're flipping the coin with [Mr Trump], whereas we know Hillary will continue to represent the banksters and represent the neoconservatives,\" he said. On the other side of the border, Americans were looking northward for hope. Canada's immigration website crashed as Trump wins continued to mount. Can they make it work? Jessica Murphy, Canada editor, BBC News Canadian prime ministers and their US counterparts have not always got along. And from policy to temperament,  it can be hard to imagine two men who have less in common than Justin Trudeau and Donald Trump. Mr Trudeau, 44,  is young, optimistic, a self-declared feminist. Mr Trump, 70, will be the oldest man ever elected US president. He painted a pessimistic view of America throughout the campaign, and has been forced to defend his treatment of women. Mr Trudeau has made tackling climate change one of his key policy issues. Mr Trump has said he would cut all US federal climate change spending and wants to dismantle the Paris climate agreement. Mr Trudeau has made openness to refugees part of his brand. Mr Trump has warned admitting refugees from certain regions presents a serious threat to US national security. But the two nations are close allies. From national security to the economy, to ensuring goods and people can move across the border, they tend to work in tandem on issues of mutual interest.

What role he'll be playing is still under wraps, but let's hope it won't be as prominent as his album is in the charts or no other actors will get a look in. It's not even Ed's first cameo appearance in a TV show - he previously appeared (and sang) in a 2015 episode of Home and Away. Sheeran is far from the first to make a brief appearance in a film or TV show - here's some other pop star cameos you may not have spotted. Cheryl in What to Expect When You're Expecting Cheryl's experience as a judge on a talent show came in handy when she made a cameo appearance as a judge on a talent show. The currently un-surnamed singer traded in The X Factor for the fictional Celebrity Dance Factor where she judged the performance of Cameron Diaz's character in 2012. Cheryl may well have revisited the movie's subject matter more recently for research purposes. Rihanna in Bring It On: All or Nothing The Bring it On series of films has brought us many stone cold classics - such as Bring it On: In It to Win It and Bring it On: Fight to the Finish. But it was the 2006 masterpiece Bring it On: All or Nothing, starring Hayden Panettiere and Solange Knowles, that gave us a delightful cameo appearance from Rihanna. Four years before she turned to S&M, a younger and more innocent RiRi was in the film offering a prize to budding cheerleading squads. Her cameo saw her announcing that the winners of a high school competition would win an appearance in her new music video. Boy George in The A-Team Boy George appeared in a 1986 episode of The A-Team called Cowboy George playing, you guessed it, the title role. In the episode, Face comes up with a money-making scheme that involves booking bands for gigs, but not actually paying them to perform. The star becomes furious Face is pocketing the profits from a Culture Club gig and turns up demanding what they're due. Highlights of the episode include Boy George kicking down a door and Mr T dancing to Karma Chameleon. Drake in Anchorman 2 To be honest, we could do an entire feature on all the cameo appearances in Anchorman 2. Kanye West, Will Smith, Harrison Ford, Sacha Baron Cohen, Amy Poehler and Tina Fey all crop up in the 2012 film. Many of them appear in the star-studded battle of the news crews at the end of the Will Ferrell movie. But Drake's guest appearance is actually right at the beginning - when his character err... expresses his approval, shall we say, of Christina Applegate's looks. Ian Brown and Jarvis Cocker in the Harry Potter films Hidden deep inside the 19 hours and 40 minutes of Harry Potter films are cameo appearances from some of UK music's biggest stars. Stone Roses frontman Ian Brown and Pulp frontman Jarvis Cocker both appear in the big screen adaptations of the JK Rowling franchise. Sadly not together. Brown is briefly seen stirring a cup of tea in The Prisoner of Azkaban while Cocker portrayed Myron Wagtail, the lead singer of The Weird Sisters, in The Goblet of Fire. Ariana Grande in Scream Queens As a rule, cameos are generally short. Ariana Grande's appearance in comedy-horror show Scream Queens certainly fell into this category, as she was so cruelly killed off at the end of her scene. The singer appeared Side to Side with the likes of Lea Michele and Emma Roberts when she starred in the show's 2015 pilot episode. But her foray into acting was short lived as she was murdered by a scary, masked knife-wielding devil. However, Ariana brilliantly came back to life just long enough to send out a tweet to her followers to let them know she was being murdered. Snoop Dogg in basically everything This feature simply wouldn't be complete without Snoop Dogg. If there was an outstanding contribution to cameos award, he should win it. He made a wonderful appearance as himself in 2015's Pitch Perfect 2 and has also cropped up in Bruno, Entourage, Bones and 2004's Starsky & Hutch. His undisputed peak, however, is surely still to come. The rapper has repeatedly said he'd love to appear in Coronation Street. He first mentioned it during a trip to Manchester in 2010.

Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme Mr Farron added: \"You always feel anger when you see dozens of mates basically and colleagues lose their seats having had an outstanding record locally and nationally. \"And I guess a sense of anger - if that is the right word -  against an election that was fought and indeed sadly won on the basis of the politics of fear. \"When one looks back at the election and you realise that the best asset David Cameron has is the SNP and the best asset the SNP has is David Cameron. \"This was an election fought basis of people terrified of the other. Fear is hugely motivating factor in elections, I'm sad to report.\" Mr Farron and his colleague Norman Lamb are seen as the frontrunners to take Mr Clegg's place. Greg Mulholland, one of the party's remaining eight MPs, said a new leader must be chosen quickly. \"We must not - and will not - wait till July to have a new leader in place. We need strong leadership now,\" he said. Several senior party figures, including former Liberal leader Lord Steel, have warned it could take decades for the party to recover from its worst election result in its history. The party has been left with a handful of MPs, including one in Scotland, one in Wales and one in London, following a series of defeats which some activists have blamed on Mr Clegg's decision to take the Lib Dems into coalition with the Conservatives in 2010. Nominations for leader will open on 13 May and close on 3 June. Ballot papers will be sent out on 24 June and must be returned by 15 July. The winner will be declared on 16 July. Neither Mr Farron, a former party president, nor Mr Lamb, a former health minister, have declared themselves as candidates. However, they are regarded as the leading contenders and both are expected to stand. Tom Brake, who served as a minister in the last government, has ruled himself out of the running and said the contest must act as a catalyst for debating the future direction of the party. \"What will happen during that contest will be that there will be an opportunity to talk about what went wrong and what sort of strategy do we put in place,\" he told the BBC's Sunday Politics. He said he was not backing anyone at this stage but that either Mr Farron or Mr Lamb would be \"fantastic leaders\". He added: \"We have had 5,000 people join our party in the last 48 hours. They will want to be part of the process.\" Mr Brake, the party's last remaining MP in London, said the capital needed a \"liberal voice\" to speak up on behalf of civil liberties and the importance of the UK remaining in the European Union. He said he had been \"lucky\" to survive the cull of Lib Dem MPs in London, suggesting the Conservatives had redeployed resources from his Carshalton and Wallington seat to higher-profile constituencies in the capital. The Liberal Democrat peer, Lady Williams, said both the Conservatives and Labour had used a \"decapitation strategy\" against Liberal Democrat MPs including Mr Cable and Mr Hughes. She suggested her party's opponents had poured vast sums of money into the election before official limits on campaign spending came into force and called for a \"much longer period\" of controls on election campaign expenditure. \"All these men and women were targeted in order to be destroyed,\" she told BBC Radio 4's World This Weekend. \"What one's looking at is not just the normal swings and balances of politics. We're looking at something much worse... namely the selling of democracy. \"The sums that were poured into this election exceed by a very long mark any of the amounts spent in recent elections.\"", "question": "The Liberal Democrat Tim Farron says his party must \" turn our anger into action \" and @placeholder from the bottom upwards .", "option_0": "rebuild", "option_1": "stemming", "option_2": "campaign", "option_3": "vanished", "option_4": "answers", "label": 0}
{"article": "Ashya was being treated in hospital in Southampton when his parents took him abroad without telling staff last year. They ignored medical advice and took him to Prague for proton beam therapy. It was later revealed Ashya did not receive subsequent chemotherapy in Prague, a move the team in Southampton say could jeopardise his recovery. Speaking exclusively to the BBC, Dr Peter Wilson, paediatric intensive care consultant at Southampton General Hospital, said: \"We are unsure as to exactly what treatment he is receiving but what we do know is... every month that goes by that he's not getting chemotherapy, his outcome worsens. \"There are experts in the country that have already quoted figures of halving survival - so survival going from 80% to 40% or 50%, which is quite dramatic.\" The Kings' version of events last year sparked a public outcry and staff members in Southampton said they received angry emails, letters and phone calls which, at one stage, forced the hospital to shut its switchboard. The King family, who in March said five-year-old Ashya was now cancer free, declined to be interviewed as part of the BBC programme. In March, four months after the proton treatment ended, Brett King told a national newspaper a recent scan showed \"no evidence\" of the tumour. But cancer experts have told the BBC although it appears Ashya is in remission it is far too early to say he has been completely cured. Oncology specialist Professor Karol Sikora said: \"Ashya is not completely out of the woods yet, but 78% of children with this type of rare cancer actually survive and are cured. \"The fact he is disease free at this point is great, but it doesn't mean he is cured yet.\" The breakdown in the relationship between Brett King and the hospital stemmed from his belief that Ashya should not receive radiotherapy and chemotherapy following surgery to remove a brain tumour. Mr King claimed in a YouTube video that staff threatened him with a court order if he refused Ashya's treatment, something the hospital has denied. He told journalists in Spain after his arrest: \"They were going to kill him in England or turn him into a vegetable.\" Through the media, the King family raised tens of thousands of pounds for Ashya's treatment before the NHS agreed to pay for proton therapy in Prague. Dr Nicky Thorp, of the Children's Cancer and Leukaemia Group of paediatricians, said: \"We were dismayed, but on reflection I can see why NHS England agreed to fund that child's case. The child was there, the child needed radiotherapy. \"The use of protons does not improve cure rates of tumours... and it saddens me to see the way the truth can be twisted and misunderstood.\" In Prague, Ashya's parents refused the chemotherapy, which had been recommended by doctors and ordered by the High Court. But in March, four months after the proton treatment ended, Mr King said his son was cancer free. Paediatric oncology consultant Dr Ramya Ramanujachar, who was involved in Ashya's treatment, warned the case could set a worrying precedent. She said: \"I don't think the parents can look after their own child with a brain tumour and be not only the carers but also the professionals directing, managing and dictating their child's treatment.\" Dr Wilson said the case had led to an \"impossible situation\" for clinicians faced with families in the same situation. \"That is deeply unfair when the NHS is always supposed to be about equal healthcare for all,\" he added.

{"article": "Allison Heathcote, 50, survived five gunshot wounds but her husband Philip, 53, died in the attack near Sousse. The pair, from Suffolk, were on their 30th wedding anniversary holiday when Islamist Seifeddine Rezgui opened fire. Mrs Heathcote said she had only realised her husband \"had not made it\" when he did not answer her. The Heathcoates, who have a son, were on the beach at the Riu Imperial Marhaba Hotel when Rezgui launched his attack on 26 June. The couple \"dived into the sand between the sun beds\", but were found by the gunman, Mrs Heathcote said in a statement read at the inquest into the deaths of 30 Britons at the Royal Courts of Justice in London. She described feeling \"pure fear\" as Rezgui wounded her, killed her husband, then walked away to murder others. After being wounded, she said: \"I stayed laying on the sand, trying not to move and draw attention to the fact that I was still alive.\" Once the sound of gunshots faded, Mrs Heathcote said, she asked her husband if he was OK. \"At the first opportunity I was asking Philip if he was alright. \"There was no response from Philip and I realised he had not made it.\" Mrs Heathcote was shot in the arm and abdomen and spent a month in an induced coma, the inquest heard. The inquest is set to hear evidence about each of the 30 Britons killed in the attack. Also on the beach was Jim Windass, 66, who had tried in vain to pull his wife Claire, 54, to safety. \"It was difficult to walk on the sand, let alone run,\" he told the inquest. The gunman fired shots as Mr Windass, who was celebrating his 65th birthday, dragged his wife from a sun bed. He described being \"on my hands and knees over Claire\", a mother-of-two from Hull, to protect her. \"But it was clear that something had happened,\" Mr Windass told  the inquest. \"There was no pulse. I closed her eyes.\" Asked what information he had received about the security situation in Tunisia or the Foreign Office travel advice when booking the holiday at a Thomson shop, he said \"none whatsoever\". Howard Stevens QC, representing Thomson's owner TUI, showed Mr Windass pages from documents sent to the couple after they booked, which contained links to travel advice pages on the Foreign Office website. Mr Windass told the lawyer: \"Because we had already been twice before and no-one had mentioned anything untoward, we booked it again.\" Who were the British victims? Ex-police officer Michael Perry, who went to Tunisia with wife Angela, also spoke to the court in person. The pair were on the beach when Mr Perry saw a \"man in black\" - the gunman Rezgui - whom he mistook for a policeman. \"My initial thought was that this was a police officer and he was dealing with a terrorist,\" he said. \"Then I realised this was the terrorist.\" Mr Perry, who retired as a Leicestershire police chief superintendent in 1998, told the inquest that the gunman fired in an \"uncontrolled manner\", suggesting he had the gun in automatic mode - where pulling the trigger results in a hail of bullets. \"He was facing in our direction and aiming downwards at people who were in the sun beds,\" he said. He added that there were no armed guards at the hotel. \"The staff were mainly female, [there was a] lot of hysteria and panic and running around,\" he said. Mr Perry and his wife hid in the basement of the spa building before creeping up to the third floor, where they saw Rezgui shoot three people by the poolside. Another survivor, Keith Hawkes, said he escaped being shot because the gunman was on his mobile phone. Mr Hawkes, a former Gurkha from Highbridge in Somerset, said in a statement that he walked past Rezgui holding an AK-47 assault rifle but assumed he was security. He \"ran past the gunman on his left-hand side, two feet from him\", but Rezgui did not notice because he was using his phone. Donna Bradley, whose parents Ray and Angie Fisher were shot dead, was the first relative to speak to the court in person. The couple, from Leicester, had been on their third trip to Tunisia, she told the inquest. They had planned to relax and organise their 50th golden wedding anniversary and Mrs Fisher's 70th birthday the following year. \"These celebrations were never to be,\" Ms Bradley said. An eyewitness saw Mr Fisher, a former engineer, as he faced his killer from a few metres away and was shot twice.

{"article": "I met Starnes, along with Ruth Dewton and Jeanne Moran Gourley, both Vietnam vets, at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington DC, known simply as The Wall. They are among more than 1,000 women, non-combatants, who served as line and staff officers and enlisted personnel in the US Army, Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps. Starnes, wearer of a Vietnam veterans' vest, has spent 17 years tracking down those women who served in non-nursing roles for her book, Women Vietnam Veterans: Our Untold Stories. After half a century of silence, these forgotten women are remembered in this monumental anthology. It is long, heavy, etched with their names, but necessary. It is the women's Wall. Starnes served as a translator before becoming a photojournalist and overseeing the publications section at Military Assistance Command Vietnam Office of Information (MACV Observer). ''I went there to see what was going on,\" says Starnes. \"I had to go and look for myself. I saw it was not the military running the war, it was politicians running the war.'' Starnes carried an army-issued Nikon camera and her own Petri camera, shooting on both Kodak colour slide film and black and white. Riding in helicopters to all parts of Vietnam, she soon learned to sit on her flak jacket to protect against the bullets and shrapnel that might hit the undercarriage. Her photos are extreme: firefights in fields of mud and bodies, children at orphanages, tall buildings blasted apart, Bob Hope entertaining the troops and WACs at downtime, their hair in rollers. ''I had no idea how bad it would be. When I took the pictures, I never let myself feel anything,\" says Starnes. \"You had to tune out emotionally. It was only when I got home that I started to realise what I'd seen.'' The photo that sticks in her mind is a picture of a little girl playing inside a roll of barbed wire. ''She could have been ripped apart. She seemed so happy at that moment and yet there were craters around. Overall the kids were so resilient, or maybe they didn't understand the seriousness of it.'' By March 1973 and the withdrawal of US troops and the remaining WACs, an estimated four million people had died in the Vietnam War. For most returning veterans there was no welcome home. Being heckled and spat on at the airport was the beginning of their private aftermath. Women especially learned to keep silent about being in 'Nam. Many just tried to get on with life, careers and families, burying their inward and outwards scars, shame or pride, horror or honour, all mixed up with memories of friendships forged and loves found. Many have died without daring to reveal they served in Vietnam. All believe it changed their lives, for better or worse, but certainly forever. Starnes returned to the US after five tours, and is decorated with the Vietnam Service Medal with Silver Star, Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal and Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross. She too tried to bury her memories in work, career and children, but eventually sought help in a group therapy session for Vietnam veterans. She was the only female in the room and was verbally abused by male veterans. She tried to explain that in Vietnam there was no safe area, everybody who served was in combat, but they didn't want to hear. She left feeling ashamed and never again sought help. In 1997, along with fellow veteran Pricilla Landry Wilkewitz she attended the dedication of the Women in Military Service for America memorial (WIMSA). They each wore a blue vest with the dates of their service written on the back, in the hope of being spotted by other women who had served in Vietnam. One thing led to another and in 1999 they formed the non-profit Vietnam Women Veterans (VWV) Inc. So began the long road tracking down others, the aim being to bring recognition for non-nursing women who served in Vietnam. That same year the group held its first Women Vietnam Veterans Conference in Olympia, Washington. For the first time, the women were recognised as Vietnam veterans and were officially told \"thank you\" and \"welcome home\". ''When I give my talks to help promote the book I begin with, 'Hi I'm Claire Brisebois Starnes and I'm a Vietnam War veteran'. I have only been able to say that since 1997. I didn't dare say it because no-one really understood. No-one cared, no-one was interested and it hurt too much.'' As I walk through the National Mall, away from the glare of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, people see Claire's vest and drift towards us. One woman, in tears, reaches out to her. Another asks, \"Can I hug a vet?\" A male veteran selling leaflets for sustenance strokes his throat where shrapnel hit and tells her: ''When I came home they called me a baby killer.''", "question": "Claire Brisebois Starnes enlisted in the Signal Corps of the US Army in 1963 as a skinny 17 - year - old who was ordered to eat more bananas to increase her weight .

{"article": "The son of a banker, Mr Krasnoff, 23, said that all changed when he was home for the summer after his freshman year at Hamilton College. That's when his childhood friend - and eventual business partner, Daniel Rudyak, 23 - pointed out an industry that was ripe for a shake-up. No, it wasn't taxis or food delivery or home cleaning - the current disruption darlings of Silicon Valley - but something a little more concrete. Well, actually - it was concrete, at least in the form of a cement truck that was trundling in front of Mr Rudyak in 2011 while he was driving in Los Angeles' notorious traffic. That's when inspiration struck. \"We realised it's so expensive to use cement trucks,\" says Mr Krasnoff. So the two began experimenting in Mr Krasnoff's backyard, mixing various types of cement and webbing, trying to figure out if there was a way to make cheap but sturdy rollable cement. The idea was that it could replace expensive mixing trucks in places that need just thin layers of cement. Drainage ditches, canal beds - mostly in developing countries in Africa - were the theoretical target. Four years and a few mishaps later (his parents' driveway still has the odd concrete splotch of a test gone awry), the geosynthetic manufacturing company that the two co-founded after dropping out of college, Cortex Composites, has received hundreds of thousands of dollars in investor funding, and just accepted its first million-dollar contracts. They're part of a growing trend of young entrepreneurs who have found themselves in an unlikely place: at the helm of firms operating in the most traditional of industries - manufacturing. Mr Krasnoff is honest about his parents' dismayed reaction when he told them that it wasn't banking - or even a traditional tech start-up - that was luring him away from university and a stable career. \"They thought it was really crazy because manufacturing is a very intense industry - it's not an app where you can go and put it on the internet and people can download it a thousand times,\" he says. But for Mr Krasnoff the appeal of actually making something tangible was irresistible. He's part of what's been called the \"hardware renaissance\" of companies looking to move beyond traditional software and into markets like wearable technologies and internet-connected devices. \"The barriers to entry for people looking to build a product are coming down - it's faster to build a prototype, social media is making it easier to market your product, and crowdfunding is making it easier to raise that first lump of money,\" says Noramay Cadena, the co-founder of Make in LA, Los Angeles' first hardware-focused incubator space. Ms Cadena worked for 10 years at traditional manufacturing firms including Boeing before founding Make in LA, which has partnered with a manufacturer, NeoTech, to help its first class of firms get their products made. She says changes in the industry - in which big firms such as Boeing and General Electric have consolidated their businesses to focus on core competencies - have opened the door a bit for quirky, smaller firms looking to enter the manufacturing space. The problem now is finding factories that will manufacture their products, as smaller firms often only place orders in the hundreds or thousands - typically far less than the normal hardware order of millions of iPhones, for example. There are three basic ways that hardware firms have solved this problem. There is the incubator model, like Made in LA, which partners with big manufacturing firms like NeoTech or Flextronics, who agree to take on some of the smaller orders as a long-term growth strategy. Some other firms first raise money via investors or crowdfunding and then use companies like Dragon Innovation, which works as a middle-man connecting firms like watch maker Pebble with contract manufacturers in China. Dragon's Scott Miller says the company primarily focuses on orders of 5,000 or more, when it becomes cost-effective to manufacture abroad. However, he says he has noticed that firms have come to him with smaller orders as of late - which is actually a boon for US manufacturing, because it is often more cost-effective to fulfill those orders here. Then there is the third option - which has also captured younger builders - of building smaller, microfactories that can contract manufacture quickly and cheaply. Jeremy Herrman, 28, and Nick Pinkston, 31, met in 2008 when they bonded of a shared love of tinkering and a mutual fascination with the still-nascent 3D printing industry. After years of hosting hardware meet-ups in cities around the globe, including their hometown of Pittsburgh and new base in San Francisco, the two realised that they were hearing the same complaint over and over again: it was difficult for hardware entrepreneurs to find manufacturers willing to take on their projects. So at the beginning of 2014, the two launched Plethora - a fully vertically integrated factory in the Dogpatch neighbourhood of San Francisco, which they filled with advanced 3D printers, robots and traditional milling machines. They currently have 20 employees and have raised more than $5m (Â£3.2m) in funding. Crucial to their effort is, of all things, software which the two custom built to allow hardware firms to upload their designs and get feedback on whether or not the object they were hoping to prototype could be built according to their specifications. Mr Hermann says that he thinks there are a lot of young software engineers like him who have turned back to manufacturing, an industry he says \"hasn't changed much in 100 years\". \"I feel like that visceral sense of holding what you build in your hand is a very strong emotion,\" he says.

{"article": "Theresa May met all the right people, the language differences did not trouble her and she refused to allow the big boys to bully her behind the bike sheds. The prime minister held her own. At the end of the two days, she had managed to speak to almost all the world leaders at the summit. They were interested because she was an unknown quantity and that rare beast, a European leader who is likely to be around for a while. They were also keen to hear what she said about Brexit. She assured them that Britain was open for business and said she had had \"pleasing and useful\" discussions about future trade deals, in particular with India, Mexico, South Korea, Singapore and Australia. She floated a few ideas of her own: the need for G20 countries to do more to stop foreign fighters dispersing to new failed states once they were squeezed out of Libya, Iraq and Syria; and the need for G20 countries to ensure that the global economy spreads wealth more fairly, an issue the Australian Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, called \"civilising capitalism\". She also banged the drum for free trade, an increasingly lonely message as electorates around the world urge their leaders to greater protectionism. The prime minister also made it abundantly clear to her fellow leaders that she won't be rushed on Brexit or Hinkley Point, the delayed nuclear plant in Somerset that China wants to invest in as an entree into the UK energy market. She dodged a row over this here by reassuring the Chinese there will be a decision by the end of this month. The message in Hangzhou was clear: Theresa May is her own woman, the Cameron era is over. And yet this summit was in truth not dominated by Brexit and the first signs emerged that Britain is not quite as prominent as it perhaps once was. The real debate was about the changing balance of power between China and the US, as evidenced by the spat over protocol and the media when President Obama arrived at the airport; the continuing uncertainty over how to fix the sluggish global economy; the fruitless talks between the Russians and the Americans over a possible cessation of hostilities in Syria; and even the regional tensions sparked by yet another missile test firing by North Korea. Brexit was a cloud on the G20 horizon, not a current storm. And what interest there was in Mrs May was focused on people's fears about the risks of Brexit. Leaders wanted to know what it would mean for them and Mrs May had few answers. The Japanese Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, in particular, made it very clear to her that his country's firms in Britain wanted more certainty. One Italian minister effectively threatened a trade war if EU nationals were stopped entirely from working in the UK. And President Obama was blunt in telling her that Britain would indeed be at the back of the queue when it came to trade deals, behind the EU and countries around the Pacific. The one moment of comfort for Mrs May came when she spotted her old university friend, Malcolm Turnbull, who was gushing in his promise of Australian trade deals and negotiating expertise. And there are signs that the US and the EU are beginning to caucus without the UK round the table: President Obama and his Secretary of State, John Kerry, chose to meet Chancellor Merkel of Germany and President Hollande of France together without inviting Mrs May. And in the official summit \"family photo\" Mrs May was placed at the distant far left, as befitted either her status as a newcomer or perhaps Britain's status post Brexit. Mrs May insisted that Britain was still playing a \"full role\" in global politics. It is a role that is certainly changing.", "question": "As first days go at an international school , the G20 @placeholder off alright for the new pupil .", "option_0": "passed", "option_1": "sets", "option_2": "tip", "option_3": "start", "option_4": "begins", "label": 0}
{"article": "It started with a strange blue smudge on a computer screen. Now that mysterious blob, spotted by a Dutch primary school teacher during a few idle hours one evening, has become one of the most remarkable recent discoveries in astronomy. Hanny's Voorwerp, named after its discoverer Hanny van Arkel, is providing scientists with a striking new window on the universe. They have found these distant clouds of glowing gas provide a kind of time capsule that can reveal what their neighbouring galaxies have been doing in the previous few thousand years. For Miss van Arkel, it is fitting for the object that now bears her name to be providing such insights - it marks 10 years since she first encountered it during her summer break from teaching. She had been taking part in a citizen science project called Galaxy Zoo, which asked members of the public to classify different types of galaxies from images taken by robotic telescopes. Launched in July 2007, Galaxy Zoo has resulted in 125 million galaxies of a wide variety of shapes and size being identified and produced 60 peer reviewed academic papers. It is an output far beyond any computer or expert, but by harnessing the power of the general public, researchers have gained an unprecedented insight into the Universe around us. \"What started as a small project has been completely transformed by the enthusiasm and efforts of the volunteers,\" said Prof Chris Lintott, an astrophysicist at the University of Oxford and co-founder of the Galaxy Zoo project. \"It has had a real impact on our understanding of galaxy evolution.\" Miss van Arkel's own contribution started on a whim. A huge Queen fan, she had been browsing the website of guitarist and astrophysicist Brian May one evening while tinkering on her own guitar. There she saw some images of some distant galaxies May had posted along with a comment urging people to sign up to the project. \"He said nobody has seen these galaxies before and that everyone could discover their own,\" explained Miss van Arkel. \"That got me interested and as I was on my summer break I signed up.\" She had only been taking part for a week when she spotted the bizarre blue blob. \"I had no idea what it was,\" she said. \"I thought it could have been a smudge on the camera maybe. There was this tutorial that showed us what we might expect to see but it didn't look anything like those on there so I sent an email to the team to ask about it.\" She also posted the image on the project's forum, which is where the object earned its name from other members who christened it Hanny's Voorwerp, or Hanny's thing. It turned out to be an entirely new object in space - one that was completely unknown to science at the time. It took almost a year of analysis and research before scientists began to unravel what it was she had found - the blue smudge was an extremely hot gas cloud with no stars in it. They believe the huge cloud of gas, which is 16,000 light-years across, had been excited by material dropping towards the supermassive black hole at the centre of a nearby galaxy, creating a kind of \"light echo\" that reverberates around inside. When the news broke, it turned Miss van Arkel into a minor celebrity in the astronomy world. \"The first time someone asked me for my autograph I thought they were joking,\" the 34-year-old explained. A decade later, another 20 of these rare intergalactic objects are thought to have been found - although many remain \"candidate\" voorwerpen until they can be examined more closely. Astronomers have turned some of the most powerful telescopes at their disposal - including the Hubble Space Telescope - towards them in an attempt to find out more. In a new paper published in the Astrophysical Journal, scientists who led the Galaxy Zoo project at the University of Alabama and University of Oxford, have examined eight of these voorwerpen, including the one originally found by van Arkel. They found they could detect variations in luminosity of the gas clouds that appear to correlate with changes in the activity of the neighbouring galaxy. In the voorwerp the researchers could detect distinct bands of brightening and fading in the light echo, which appears correlate to changes that occurred in the galaxy in the past. In the voorwerp next to the distinctive Teacup galaxy, which is 1.1 billion light years from Earth, the researchers saw a brightening and then two periods of fading, which indicate a rise and then drop in activity, all within a period of 55,000 years. They saw similar patterns in the other voorwerp they looked at, including Hanny's Voorwerp, which lies next to a galaxy called IC 2497. \"It suggests parts of the Universe where we have active galaxies can change very rapidly,\" explained Professor Lintott. \"When we talk about activity at the centre of galaxies, we're talking about material dropping toward the black hole. This can lead to material being ejected from the centre in the form of jets of material moving close to the speed of light. These jets are what we think excite the gas in the voorwerpen. \"If things can change so rapidly in active galaxies, it may cause us to change how we think about our own galaxy, which is thought to be not active. These findings suggest it might have been in the recent past. Those systems close to the galactic centre would not have been pleasant places to be.\" Peering at galaxies millions of light years away means we are also seeing them millions of years in the past. The voorwerp light echos, however, provide a record of what has happened in a galaxy's recent past - something that would be otherwise impossible to see. \"It is fantastic, as we don't have anything else that lets us see what is going on in the Universe on this sort of timescale,\" said Professor Lintott. \"We can see what is going on during a human lifetime and we can look back millions of years at a population of galaxies far away, so this could be really useful as we find more of them.\" For Miss van Arkel, however, it the beauty of the object she discovered that is still most striking. \"The Hubble images have been amazing,\" said Miss van Arkel. \"Some images it is green and kind of looks like a tree frog. You can see these orange spots where the eyes would be and apparently this is where new stars are forming.\" But the voorwerpen are not the only discovery to have emerged from the Galaxy Zoo project. Strange green balls - which became known as Green Peas by the affable \"zooites\" involved in the project - were a completely new type of galaxy that was spotted by participants. The eagle-eyed Ms van Arkel was also among the first to notice these too. Galaxy Zoo was so successful it has also spawned a whole family of other citizen science projects that are now conducted under the umbrella of the Zooniverse project. Members of the public can log on to classify everything from snapshots of animals in the Serengeti and count seals in the Weddell Sea to helping computers recognise animal faces and transcribing handwritten documents from the time of Shakespeare. It became so vast it quickly outgrew its old servers at Johns Hopkins University in the US, and now runs off the virtual servers hosted by Amazon Web Services. One offspring project to identify objects in our own galaxy has resulted in another recent discovery - small, round yellow objects scattered throughout the Milky Way. These \"Yellow Balls\" were found to be extremely massive stars cocooned inside dust. The project has found thousands in our galaxy. But the legacy of Galaxy Zoo could be something even more significant than a handful of new objects - it has changed the way science is done. Dr Karen Masters, an astrophysicist at Portsmouth University and project scientist for Galaxy Zoo said: \"We're genuinely asking for help with something we cannot do ourselves and the results have made a big contribution to the field.\"", "question": "Galaxy Zoo began with a call for volunteers to help classify distant galaxies in space telescope images .

{"article": "Onetime rival Jeb Bush was fond of saying that the presumptive Republican nominee relied on \"the shows\" to inform his campaign. While Bush meant it as a putdown, the former Florida governor may have been on to something. Trump is no stranger to \"the shows\".  He's been a frequent guest on talk shows for decades and hosted NBC's Apprentice and its spin-off Celebrity Apprentice for 14 seasons. So have any reality TV techniques crept onto the campaign trail? As seen on TV: (The Real Housewives series) If you're a Real Housewife of wherever, the cocktail party is your battlefield. And America's wealthy socialites always bring back-up - the feistier, the better. Housewives have been known to add a wildcard guest into the mix to throw their rivals off their game (and create plausibility deniability). In season one of the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, Camille Grammer famously invited psychic medium Allison Dubois to a supposedly staid dinner party. \"Your husband will never emotionally fulfil you. Ever,\" she told one of Grammer's flummoxed frenemies. As seen on the campaign trail: Trailing in the polls to Ben Carson and Ted Cruz before the Iowa caucus, Trump needed to shake things up. Enter Sarah Palin. The onetime vice-presidential candidate and former governor of Alaska emerged from the political wilderness to give the Trump campaign a shot in the arm. She endorsed Trump with a mystifying speech. \"They didn't want to talk about these issues until he brought 'em up. In fact, they've been wearing a, this, political correctness kind of like a suicide vest,\" she said among other things. For a whole day the focus was off his rivals. (See also: Knight, Bobby; Arpaio, Joe) As seen on TV: (Survivor) Survivor -  where castaways compete in a remote locale with nothing but their wits and a few tools - is credited with ushering in a wave of reality TV in the US. The show became a national phenomenon in the summer of 2000 not because of challenges of the island but because of its politics. Winner Richard Hatch, a pudgy corporate trainer, entered into a pact with three fellow, fitter contestants, keeping him in the game long enough to betray them. As seen on the campaign trail: Although their relationship eventually soured, Trump and Cruz enjoyed a whirlwind \"bromance\" in the summer of 2015. The two hosted a rally protesting against President Barack Obama's Iran deal in front of the US Capitol and were positively chummy at several of the debates. \"I like Donald Trump. He's bold; he's brash... I'm not interested in Republican-on-Republican violence,\" Cruz said in July. The Texas senator helped Trump clear the crowded field of candidates, only to find himself the victim of Republican-on-Republican violence. As seen on TV:  (Project Runway, Top Chef, etc) The phrase \"throwing someone under the bus\" doesn't involve public transport, but rather stabbing a friend in the back on national television.  The phrase is a mainstay in competition shows like Project Runway, Top Chef and America Next Top Model.  When contestants are about to be judged, they often target the weakest link to survive. As seen on the campaign trail: Like Cruz, Trump started out as a friend of Carson, the kindly retired neurosurgeon who also ran as an outsider candidate. But Trump changed his tone once Carson crept ahead of him in the polls as the Iowa caucus drew closer. Trump went for the jugular calling him \"pathological\" and comparing him to child molester. Ouch. As seen on TV: (The Real World)  \"Find out what happens, when people stop being polite, and start getting real,\" is how the granddaddy of all American reality TV shows opened on MTV in 1992. The housemates would encamp in \"the confessional\" - a spare room where they could look directly into the camera and tell the producers exactly how they felt. The behind-the-scenes look help give the impression of a raw unvarnished show. As seen on the campaign trail: While other candidates play to the crowd, Trump's number one priority is the camera and while on camera he leaves little unsaid.  Also, no one another candidate in the modern political history has been so enamoured with the process of politics. Trump talks about polls (endlessly), reporters and other candidates' strategies - things that until the 2016 race were the realm of political blogs not stump speeches.  But all the while his supporters feel like they're in the loop. As seen on TV: (Almost every reality show produced) It's a poorly kept-secret that reality TV producers love drama. And every reality TV contestant knows, the more drama you create the longer you stay on television. Many a combative star has been saved from the chopping block because of their potential for more bad behaviour. As seen on the campaign trail:  Now that Trump knocked out 16 other Republican candidates you'd think he'd take well-deserved break from feuding before tackling Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee. But there's no rest for the cantankerous. In the past few days, Trump has tussled with the New York Times, Senator Elizabeth Warren, CNN, House Speaker Paul Ryan, British Prime Minister David Cameron and London Mayor Sadiq Khan, just to name a few.

{"article": "The government will now face the challenge of negotiating the terms of the post-exit relationship between the UK and the EU. Many of the issues that will have to be resolved are economic. They will include the kind of trade relationship the UK will have with the remainder of the EU, as well as what access will be available to Europeans wanting to work in the UK. For trade issues there are two groups of countries that the UK will need to think about in the exit negotiations - the other 27 EU members themselves, and the nations that have some sort of trade agreement with the union. For the EU, British exporters currently have access to their markets without tariffs (taxes on traded goods) or other barriers.  They in turn have access to the UK. Will that arrangement continue after Britain has left? That is a matter for negotiation and some EU figures have raised serious doubts.  Their inclination to take a tough position in the negotiations is to discourage Eurosceptic movements in other countries from believing the grass is greener outside. Leave campaigners argue that another incentive will dominate - the need for their exporters to have access to the UK market. They often mention German cars and French cheese and wine in this context. We have already had a strong hint of this. The German industry association told the BBC that trade barriers would be \"very, very foolish\". Access for services companies would need to be negotiated.  Financial services such as insurance and banking are especially important to the UK economy. Similar questions arise in relation to the non-EU countries with which the bloc has trade agreements that involve various degrees of openness. The countries concerned include Turkey, South Korea and Chile.  If Britain is to continue with the benefits of these agreements, negotiations will be necessary. There is also an agreement with Canada awaiting implementation, and one with the US - the controversial Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership or TTIP - under discussion. If the talks - with the EU and third countries - don't reach a deal before the EU exit takes effect, then under World Trade Organisation rules both the UK and the EU would be obliged to apply to each other the tariffs and other trade restrictions they apply to the rest of the world. That is because the WTO rules only allow countries to discriminate in favour of a trade partner in a limited number of circumstances - including a full bilateral trade deal. There will be decisions to be taken about immigration, especially access to jobs in the UK for workers from the EU. That is required under the trade agreement that Norway, for example, has with the EU. It is certainly possible the EU would seek a similar deal with the UK in return for other concessions, but it would be politically difficult for a British government aware that immigration concerns were such an important factor in the referendum result. There may also be negotiations about the EU budget. Norway contributes to some EU spending programmes, and again, the EU could seek something similar from the UK. That too would be politically challenging as one key theme in the Leave campaign was the financial savings they sought by ending Britain's EU Budget contribution.", "question": "Britain has @placeholder and is heading for the European Union 's exit door .", "option_0": "fallen", "option_1": "grown", "option_2": "voted", "option_3": "announced", "option_4": "attacked", "label": 2}

{"article": "While thousands of people across Britain were infected with Hepatitis C and HIV through NHS blood products, the inquiry was focused on victims in Scotland. It has been described as the worst treatment disaster in the history of the NHS. The report looked at people in Scotland who were infected with blood-borne viruses - HIV and Hepatitis C - in the course of medical treatment on the NHS. The period scrutinised by the inquiry began on 1 January 1974 and ended on 1 September 1991, when screening of donated blood for the Hepatitis C virus was introduced throughout the UK. The infections came from blood which had been donated by people who had the viruses. Some were infected during blood transfusions for illness, injury or during childbirth or surgery. In the case of haemophilia therapy it occurred as a result of transfusions of blood products made from large pools of donations and given to remedy the deficiency of clotting factor in a patient's blood. About 2,500 people are thought to have been infected with Hepatitis C by blood transfusion on the NHS in Scotland. At least 18 were infected with HIV. The report said a further 478 bleeding disorder patients (haemophiliacs) are thought to have been infected with hepatitis C, and 60 with HIV, from blood products. A statement from Lord Penrose read out at the publication of the report said: \"The state of knowledge of each virus informed the inquiry's assessments of the acting of doctors.\" HIV was first identified in 1983 but international acceptance did not \"crystalise\" until 1984. The report said testing for HIV in blood products was not possible before the virus was identified. The Lord Penrose's statement said: \"Some commentators believe that more could have been done to prevent infection in particular groups of patients. \"Careful consideration of the evidence has however revealed few aspects in which matters should or, more importantly, could have been handled differently. \"In relation to HIV/Aids it appeared to the inquiry that when actions in Scotland were subjected to international comparison they held up well. \"Once the risk had emerged all that could reasonably be done was done in the areas of donor selection, heat treatment of products and screening of donated blood. \"Other than by a general cessation of therapy with concentrates, the infection of haemophilia patients with HIV over the period 1980-1984 could not have been prevented.\" It said the science of the hepatitis C virus was not understood in the 1970s and identification of the \"causative virus\" did not take place until 1988. Lord Penrose's statement said: \"As with HIV it was not possible to test the native blood for the virus until the virus had been discovered, although alternatives including testing for other indicators of infection were adopted in some countries.\" The first test kits for hepatitis C virus only became available in November 1989. The inquiry did point to a delay in the introduction of the screening of donated blood for the hepatitis C virus. It said a decision on screening should have been taken by middle of May 1990 rather than in November 1990. It then took 10 months to implement. Issues in England and Wales led to a delay in Scotland, despite it being ready to implement the screening. The last year that blood donations were collected from prisoners in Scotland was 1984. By this time only a small proportion of blood was coming from prisons. The report said the Home Office in the 1970s liked blood donations from prisoners as it was thought they were making \"restitution\" for their crimes. But there was little information on how many prisoners were drug users and thus a risk of having infections. The inquiry heard from Scottish National Blood Transfusion experts that \"with the benefit of hindsight\" taking blood from prisoners was \"inadvisable and should have stopped earlier\". Heat treatment ended the transmission of HIV by NHS blood products in Scotland by October 1985, and from commercial products by about the same time. The report said there may subsequently have been \"isolated\" infections from donors who had the virus but had not created antibodies. Further developments in heat treatments also made blood products safe against the hepatitis C virus by 1987. The inquiry's single recommendation is that the Scottish government takes all reasonable steps to offer a hepatitis C test to everyone in Scotland who had a blood transfusion before September 1991 and who has not been tested for the disease.", "question": "The long - awaited report by Lord Penrose into patients being infected by @placeholder blood supplies in the 1970s and 1980s has been published .", "option_0": "wearing", "option_1": "contaminated", "option_2": "suspected", "option_3": "failing", "option_4": "limited", "label": 1}
{"article": "On a late Sunday afternoon in the Netherlands, Dina Asher-Smith felt like she always does on a start line. \"I love to race,\" she says. \"I'm not an adrenaline junkie but I like feeling nervous. I like the thrill. A lot of the coaches laugh at me and tell me I'm crazy.\" Having finished her first-year exams at King's College London six days earlier, the world junior sprint champion felt free. And as she knelt on the track to prepare for the starter's gun, her coach's words were still reverberating in her ears. John Blackie had used his favourite phrase. \"Don't hold the horses,\" he told his pupil, before sending her into battle. The 19-year-old had no expectations of that summery May day in Hengelo. She isn't one for predictions. All the European indoor 60m silver medallist wanted to do was eradicate some of the inconsistencies which had been bothering her in training. \"I wanted to make sure I didn't tighten up, didn't panic, and went through some technical points successfully,\" says the athlete who only took sprinting seriously after winning world relay bronze in 2013. Bang. The Briton catapults out of the blocks. But, as she rises, she is not at ease. \"The start wasn't good, I popped out of my drive. I was thinking 'this is a mess',\" she remembers. The Londoner covers 20m, eats up another 30m, but by the time she is halfway down the track European 100m and 200m champion Dafne Schippers is preparing to overtake and Asher-Smith is annoyed: \"I was thinking 'this isn't how I wanted it to go'. From that point on, I was just trying to tidy it up.\" The benefit of being a sprinter is that by the time they wish a race over, it usually is.  \"I saw the line coming and I really wasn't happy,\" says the usually sanguine student. Fortunately for the history undergraduate, her team-mate CJ Ujah - the man who last year, on the same track, became the fifth Briton to break the 10-second barrier - was waiting near the finish line. \"If he hadn't been there I probably would have left the track,\" says the Briton. \"It wasn't awful, it wasn't abysmal, but it wasn't the race plan I intended to run and I was quite sad.\" In assuming she had finished third, Asher-Smith looked at the scoreboard and noticed four digits - 11.02 - appear alongside the name of the second-placed athlete. Gloom and regret lingered until Ujah told his friend that it was she who had come second, that it was she who had become the fastest British woman in history, bettering her personal best by 0.12 seconds and breaking the previous national record of 11.05 secs, set by Montell Douglas in 2008. \"I started jumping around,\" Asher-Smith remembers, laughing with ease. \"I saw my mum and dad and bounced over to them. I was so so happy. I thought mum was going to cry, and she probably did knowing her. For them both to be there and see me break the British record meant a lot.\" How does a teenager celebrate running quicker than any British female before her? By sitting in a nondescript room for 90 minutes, drinking, drinking, drinking, until her bladder filled up. \"I had to go straight to anti-doping and I couldn't pee,\" she says, giggling before apologising for being \"disgusting\", which sparks more laughter. Did the other athletes being tested congratulate her? Was there a fist pump or a high-five, perhaps? No, but she would not have expected them to. \"They're from different countries and wouldn't have known it was a national record,\" she explains. \"But my manager was there with me, bouncing up and down. When I got back to the hotel I had some dinner before the restaurant closed, saw a few people, and had to do a warm-down session in the pool. By the time that was finished it was 11pm. I had to be out of the hotel by 4am so I just packed, slept and left.\" On her return to England there were hundreds of congratulatory messages, from athletes, friends and fans, on Twitter, Facebook and her phone. \"It all went crazy,\" is Asher-Smith's take on the week that followed. For an athlete who likes to respond to every message she receives, the reaction to her record-breaking feat was overwhelming, and there was one message, from a school friend, which made her tearful. \"She said I'd made Newstead Wood School proud and so many of my school friends either liked or commented on that message,\" Asher-Smith says, her voice still disbelieving. \"It made me grateful and I realised there are far more people wanting me to do well than I realised.\" There were those who criticised the media coverage of the sprinter's achievement, saying she did not get the recognition she deserved. But Asher-Smith argues with equanimity on behalf of both sides, referencing the sports she had to compete with that day: the climax of the Premier League season, Test cricket, the Monaco Grand Prix, to name but a few. \"I didn't notice and I really don't know what my opinion on it is,\" she says. \"But athletics, and female athletes, do have to battle for headlines.\" Three years ago, when the nation was giddy on Olympic sports, Asher-Smith was entering and leaving the Olympic stadium as an unknown charged with carrying boxes of kit for those she hoped, one day, to emulate. She accepts she has come a long way in a short time. \"I definitely wouldn't have imagined I'd be a British record holder back then, but I don't want to reflect on it too much because you get caught up in the moment,\" she says, before discussing the difficulties of juggling studying with training. School is out for the summer, allowing Asher-Smith to concentrate on her sport without the distraction of revising, for example, for a module on medieval Europe, which gave her a headache. The intensity of her training will remain the same because the fastest teenager in the world has an elite athlete's regime: usually a two-hour session at Norman Park track in Bromley between 7pm and 9pm after a day of lectures and study. \"The training and University schedules have both been challenging, but if I want to do well in both I can't let either slip,\" she says, hinting at the work ethic which allowed her to achieve straight As in her A-levels last year, whilst also training to become world junior 100m champion and a European 200m finalist. Asked what her targets are for the rest of the season, the fastest woman in Britain does not set her sights on conquering the world but on a place in the national team at this summer's World Championships. Fighting with her for a place in Beijing are a number of high-class sprinters: Jodie Williams, the 200m Commonwealth Games silver medallist, Bianca Williams - a Commonwealth 200m bronze medallist - and European 100m bronze medallist Ashleigh Nelson. Asha Philip, the third quickest British female in history, is also a contender. \"It might sound underwhelming but, with how sprinting is now in the UK, it's definitely a challenge to make the team,\" says Asher-Smith, who will take on Allyson Felix and Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce in the 200m this Sunday at the Birmingham Grand Prix. \"Maybe if I was in a different country, a different environment, maybe I could look beyond qualification but I definitely can't take my place on the team for granted.\" Watch live coverage of the Birmingham Grand Prix online and on BBC Two from 13:30 BST (15:55 in Northern Ireland) on Sunday, 7 June.", "question": "History is not always achieved through @placeholder .

Tiote is gone and nothing is being done.\" Kanu was sidelined for nine months just after winning Olympic gold in 1996 when doctors at his Italian club Inter Milan found a heart defect. He was allowed to resume his career after a successful operation in Ohio in the United States. The former Arsenal striker had further heart surgery in 2014. The 40-year-old, who also played for Ajax Amsterdam and Portsmouth, is planning to build a $17 million dollar cardiac hospital in Abuja, Nigeria. He also wants to build similar hospitals in east, north and southern Africa. \"One man can not do everything. What happened to Tiote is a lesson to us all. We can't let it go on like this,\" Kanu told BBC Sport. \"We should talk more about it, information needs to get out there because the problem is huge. \"Our dream is to build a hospital in Nigeria and four other countries in Africa. \"The funds have been the issue but if we can make it happen it's going to help a lot because right now we are taking the kids to India and it cost a lot.\" So far the Kanu Heart Foundation has facilitated 538 successful operations in England, India, Nigeria and Israel. The foundation office in Lagos, Nigeria, receives eight to ten calls everyday from people seeking help to treat heart-related problems. Lagos University student, Enitan Adesola is one of the very first beneficiaries of the help offered by Kanu. \"I have to thank him very much for taking a big decision to help me because you can't just not know someone and try to help that person,\" she said. \"He's been like a father to me, like a mother, he's just been great to me. I am really grateful.\" To raise the funds for the hospital project Kanu is bringing together his team-mates at Ajax, Inter Milan, Arsenal and Portsmouth for two charity matches to be played in Lagos and Johannesburg later this year.", "question": "Former Nigeria captain Nwankwo Kanu says the recent death of Ivory Coast 's Cheick Tiote should be a wake - up call to @placeholder over heart problems in Africa .", "option_0": "act", "option_1": "rest", "option_2": "control", "option_3": "achieve", "option_4": "provide", "label": 0}

Police are hunting for the children's father, Arthur Simpson-Kent, who travelled to Ghana days after they were reported missing. The Ghanaian Police said their help was requested two days ago. Detectives have been sent to the Cape Coast in the south of the country - where the extended Simpson family is from - as well as to other parts of the Atlantic shoreline. In addition, police checks are in place on all of Ghana's official borders. The authorities said while there is no official immigration record of Mr Simpson-Kent leaving the country, the delay in alerting them means he may have left via the borders into Togo, Burkino Faso or the Ivory Coast. BBC correspondent Alistair Leithead who is in Ghana said while there have been some reported sightings of him, the investigation was low-key and had not been reported in newspapers nor on television. No appeal has been made for his arrest. Ms Blake and the couple's sons were not seen after 13 December but a missing persons inquiry was not launched until 16 December, when the NSPCC raised concerns about their welfare. Police attended the family's home in south-east London and spoke to Mr Simpson-Kent, but that is the last time he was seen. A search at the home uncovered three bodies in the garden on 5 January and police said significant attempts had been made to conceal them. They all died from head and neck injuries, police said.

South East Coast Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust (Seacamb) covers Kent, Surrey, Sussex, Brighton and North East Hampshire.

How call handling was changed Secamb provides NHS 111 services across the region and responds to 999 calls. Some NHS 111 calls were transferred to the 999 system to give Secamb more time for more urgent calls. The calls affected were in the second most serious category - Category A Red 2 - which covers conditions like strokes or fits but which are less critical than where people are non responsive. Under NHS rules, calls designated as life-threatening are supposed to receive an ambulance response within eight minutes. The trust allowed itself an extra 10 minutes to deal with some calls by \"re-triaging\" patients in the 999 system.

{"article": "Media playback is not supported on this device City - without needing to be anywhere near their best against the team that took the title race to its final day last season - were already cruising with a two-goal lead when Aguero made his 69th-minute entrance as a substitute for the limping Edin Dzeko. In the space of those few seconds the Argentina forward strolled onto the pitch at Etihad Stadium and right onto the end of Jesus Navas's perfect pass to put the home side out of sight of Liverpool and maintain their 100% start to the season. It was a symbolic, highly impressive demonstration of the power City manager Manuel Pellegrini has at his disposal, made even more emphatic as it was produced against a Liverpool side that had the title in their grasp in late April only to stumble near the finishing line. Watching it all, impassively for the most part, was the man who has been consigned to City's past but who is now entrusted with ensuring Liverpool have a bright future after the departure to Barcelona of last season's 31-goal top scorer Luis Suarez. Mario Balotelli's face was cheered when it appeared on the big screens as he remains a popular figure with City's supporters, but just hours after the 24-year-old was officially confirmed as a Liverpool player he had the size of the task awaiting him laid out by his former employers. Many have predicted the title will be a two-horse race this season - and even though the campaign is only two games old it already looks like City and Chelsea will be the teams best equipped to last the course. Adding to that impression was the fact that the real architect of City's win was another talented individual they were barely able to call upon when they reclaimed the Premier League. Stevan Jovetic came to Liverpool's attention as a teenager when he scored both goals in Fiorentina's shock Champions League win against them in 2009, but injuries have meant a wait to see him look at his best for City after they paid £22m for the Montenegro forward in July 2013. Two goals here - the second a magnificent team creation which he started and finished - hinted that this could be his season if he remains in good health. Jovetic started with Dzeko, allowing Pellegrini to ease Aguero back after his own injury difficulties. If all three stay fit and Alvaro Negredo comes back as he did in the early part of last season, City will be the benchmark for attacking threat. City eventually won with ease after an awkward first 40 minutes. The three points were earned with a comfort they never enjoyed in the 2-1 victory against Liverpool at home last season, remembering they also lost a 3-2 thriller at Anfield. This was routine once Liverpool's poor defending allowed Jovetic to give City the lead. The gap between the sides looked wider than at any point last season, although this must also be placed in context by the early stage of the campaign. For Liverpool and manager Brendan Rodgers, the dilemma has been an obvious one. How can he reassemble his squad to compensate for the loss of Suarez, not just his goals but also the psychological impact and pressure he applied to opposing players and supporters? There will be a sense of relief among opponents that he is not around to torment them, while it will also take his former Anfield team-mates time to get used to not having such a lethal weapon in their armoury. There is rarely any good news in selling your best player but Rodgers is determined not to let this be an issue that overshadows the new arrivals. Of course Suarez would have been banned here anyway, and it is absolutely right that Rodgers is allowed time to see how reinforcements such as Balotelli, Lazar Markovic and, when fit, Adam Lallana fare. He has the nucleus of the squad that did so brilliantly in vain last season, including the attacking gifts of Daniel Sturridge and Raheem Sterling, who will presumably need to dovetail with Balotelli. Rodgers admits he has taken \"a calculated risk\" on Balotelli. He is banking on the Italian showing hitherto undetected maturity while also accepting the reality that if he fails at Liverpool his career will be regarded as one in decline. Ironically, given the focus on Liverpool's attacking resources and how Suarez can be replaced, it was familiar troubles further back that were actually at the root of their downfall. Rodgers was right to contend that Liverpool were the better team for 40 minutes, but once Jovetic took advantage of Dejan Lovren's poor header and debutant Alberto Moreno's switch-off the game was up. Lovren, the £20m signing from Southampton, had an uncomfortable night, while Moreno - a £12m arrival from Sevilla - was swiftly acquainted with the need for maximum concentration in the Premier League. Liverpool's performances and finishing position last season put Rodgers way ahead of schedule. A top four place - even if it means finishing lower than second - should be regarded as satisfactory. For City, expectation will be the retention of the title and further progress in the Champions League. And what better way to show they mean business by dispensing comfortably with last season's league runners-up without getting anywhere near their top gear.

{"article": "Despite that, Victorian explorer Joseph Thomson is almost unknown in his native Scotland. Thomson was born in Penpont, Dumfriesshire, in 1858, the son of a stonemason and quarry owner. He developed a love for botany and geology and studied at the University of Edinburgh. But he also had the explorer's bug, leading several expeditions to Africa in the 1870s and 1880s, including one for the Royal Geographical Society to identify a trade route through the territory of the feared Maasai warriors. \"He could have been in mortal danger,\" said John Hastings-Thomson, the explorer's great grand-nephew, who believes he might easily have been mistaken for a white slaver and killed. I am making history as the first ever Maasai elder to visit his birthplace...It really means a lot to me as it is something that has been in my mind since I was a child. Instead, however, Thomson managed to befriend the Maasai and earn their trust, respect and protection. Warriors escorted him along the way, keeping him safe from the dangers of wild animals and other hostile tribes. Thomson had a motto:  \"He who goes gently goes safely; he who goes safely goes far.\" \"I think this encapsulates his way of doing things and ensured his survival,\" said Mr Hastings-Thomson.  \"He didn't go blundering in, all-guns-blazing.  He was willing to be patient and negotiate his way through.\" That is certainly how Thomson is remembered in Maasai-land, now part of modern Kenya. \"One of the things that stands out about Joseph Thomson is his humbleness,\" said Ezekiel Katato, a village elder in one of the Maasai communities Thomson visited. \"He went through the land and avoided at all cost confrontation with anyone along the way. \"He was also very brave because he was going through a land unknown to him and to the world.  He really didn't know what would happen to him the next day, or the next minute.\" Mr Katato relates how Thomson endeared himself to Maasai women with gifts of beads, and intrigued the warriors with his dentures! \"They thought he was a magician because he had these teeth that he could remove at will and put back to his mouth,\" he said. \"It's a story that has been passed on from generation to generation!\" Mr Katato learned about, and was inspired by, Thomson as a schoolboy.  So much so that he has now travelled to Scotland to trace the explorer's footsteps. Striding through the sleepy village of Penpont, the tall imposing black man in bright purple robes does look quite incongruous.  But no more so than a young white Scotsman would have looked in Africa 130 years ago. \"Today I am making history as the first ever Maasai elder to visit his birthplace here in Penpont,\" declared Mr Katato with pride. \"It really means a lot to me as it is something that has been in my mind since I was a child.\" The main reason for his visit is to join family members and supporters to launch the Joseph Thomson Maasai Trust in Penpont on Saturday. It is being established to promote Thomson's life and legacy in Scotland and further afield and also a Thomson trail that Mr Kakato has developed along 65 miles of the 1,500-mile route the explorer followed. Mr Hastings-Thomson has already tackled it twice and said it was \"an amazing experience\". The aim now is to interest people, especially young people, from Scotland and elsewhere to travel to Kenya to take part in the next walk in June 2017. \"I think it is very important to get young people from all over the world to join the young people of Maasai-land to walk in the footsteps of Joseph Thomson, to bring different cultures together and to use their talents and energies to work for peace and make beautiful memories,\" said Mr Katato. \"I particularly wanted to organise this walk because of the respect I have for him (Thomson) and to promote his legacy because he is a man worth remembering in our community.\" He shares Mr Hastings-Thomson's sadness that Joseph Thomson is today largely forgotten in Scotland. There is a monument to him in Thornhill where he went to school and he is buried in the town's churchyard. Thomson died in 1895 at the young age of 37.

{"article": "In English, you either say \"sorry\" or \"apologies\". In Japanese, there are at least 20 different ways. One of the most casual and most frequently used words is \"gomen\" ごめん. You can make it more formal by saying \"gomen-nasai\" ごめんなさい or more friendly with \"gomen-ne\" ごめんね.  \"Warui warui\" 悪い悪い or \"my bad\" is also a very casual way to say sorry. \"Sumimasen\" すみません, which can be translated as \"excuse me\", also works as an apology depending on how it is used. \"Yurushite\" 許して is to ask for forgiveness and \"kanben\" 勘弁 can be used to plead for mercy and both terms are used much more casually than in English. Viewpoint: Why do Japan’s apologies get disregarded? More formal ways to apologise include \"moushiwake nai\" 申し訳ない and \"shazai\" 謝罪. But I use both terms quite often in business emails not because I really feel bad but just to be polite. For example, I may begin my correspondence with \"I am sorry for the delay in getting back to you\" and end it with \"I apologise for creating extra work for you\" even if it only took me a few days to respond and even if I was merely asking them to do what's already in their job description. If I genuinely want to apologise, at least three or four different phrases would appear in one short email. I may be \"too embarrassed to face you\" 合わせる顔がない and \"I have no excuse\" 弁解の余地がない for whatever I did. For the post-war apologies, Japanese leaders have used the word \"hansei\" 反省 much more frequently. In the English transcript, it reads \"remorse\" but I would translate it as \"regret\" and use it, for example, for failing to be more productive on my day off. A student would be told to \"hansei\" for forgetting to do one's homework. Its Chinese or Korean equivalents - \"fǎnshè\" or \"banseong\" respectively - also mean \"reflection on\" or \"reconsideration of\" the past. The 1995 statement by former Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama was considered landmark because it included the word \"owabi\" お詫び which is one of the most formal ways of apologising. He said his country had caused \"tremendous damage and suffering\" through its \"colonial rule and aggression\" and expressed \"deep remorse\" and stated his \"heartfelt apology\". Ten years later to mark 60 years since the end of the World War Two, the then Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi also used the term \"owabi\".

{"article": "Graphene, one-atom-thick sheets of carbon, can carry electric charges far faster than currently used materials. But it has proven difficult to make it behave as a semiconductor like silicon, or to attach \"contacts\" to the sheets. A study in Nature Communications  solves those problems by cooking up graphene from a material called silicon carbide. Graphene was discovered in 2004 by two University of Manchester scientists - winning them             the 2010 Nobel prize  in physics. It has been the focus of intense research efforts to exploit its phenomenal mechanical strength and favourable electronic properties. Because sheets of it are so thin and it conducts electric charges so well, it is already being used as a crystal-clear \"electrode\" for solar cells, and will soon find its way into consumer products including smartphones and televisions. The greatest hope, however, is that it can be used in semiconductor applications, working with or replacing the industry's standard material of silicon. To make faster computer chips, the industry has been working relentlessly to shrink the individual transistors - and is heading for a physical limit to just how small they can go. Since charges zip through graphene hundreds of times faster than in silicon, a jump in speed could be made with no decrease in size - but efforts to integrate graphene into chips have been difficult. One problem is that while pure graphene is a particularly good conductor, it is a terrible semiconductor - the kind of material needed to make transistors. While a number of different transistors have been produced using graphene, they have required modifications to it that degrade its electrical performance. Another issue is the fact that adding metal contacts to graphene - to shuttle electric charges into and out of it - is tricky, and often results in damage. To tackle both issues, researchers at Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg in Germany have enlisted the help of a somewhat lesser-known material called silicon carbide - a simple crystal made of silicon and carbon. In 2009, several members of the same team             reported in Nature Materials  that when wafers of the material were baked, silicon atoms were driven out of the crystal's topmost layer, leaving behind just carbon in the form of graphene. In the new work, the team joined Swedish research institute Acreo AB, using a high-energy beam of charged atoms to etch \"channels\" into thin silicon carbide wafers defining where different transistor parts would be. The team's crucial step was to allow a bit of hydrogen gas in during this process. This affected how the top graphene layer was chemically joined to the underlying silicon carbide: either making a given region conducting or semiconducting, depending on the etched channels. The way the hydrogen atoms fit themselves into the interface changes the nature of the chemical bonds between the two layers. Quentin Ramasse, a researcher at the SuperStem Laboratory in Daresbury, UK - whose work recently             showed that holes in graphene \"heal themselves\"  - called the work \"really impressive\". \"That's really what they've nailed: controlling that last little bit of bonding to make one type of contact or another,\" Dr Ramasse told BBC News. \"That's what the hold-up has been, being able to tailor that contact to suit whatever you want to use it for, and have it all in the one chip.\" \"You read everywhere that graphene is magical for this reason and that, and it's good to be reminded that you can put it in real devices and make it scalable and actually use it for technological applications,\" he said. \"That's a very good step forward.\"", "question": "The hope for the \" @placeholder material \" graphene to fulfil its promise in electronics has received a boost - by changing the recipe when cooking it .", "option_0": "deadline", "option_1": "living", "option_2": "raw", "option_3": "fuel", "option_4": "miracle", "label": 4}

Experts said such technology, which has been effective in animal experiments, was the \"holy grail of nanomedicine\". Cancer scientists are trying to harness the transporting abilities of these fatty spheres by getting them to carry toxic drugs to tumours. \"The difficulty is, how do you release them when they reach their target?\" Prof Kostas Kostarelos, from the University of Manchester, told the BBC News website.

But when the temperature increases to 42C they become leaky. \"The challenge for us is to try to develop liposomes in such a way that they will be very stable at 37C and not leak any cancer drug molecules and then abruptly release them at 42C,\" Prof Kostarelos added. He suggests heat pads could be used to warm tumours on the body surface such as skin, head or neck cancers. Probes can heat tumours inside the body, and there is also discussion about using ultra sound to warm tumours. In early tests on mice with melanoma there was \"greater uptake\" of drugs in tumours using the thermal grenades. And that resulted in a \"moderate improvement\" in survival rates. Prof Kostarelos said similar techniques were being trialled in patients and this \"is not a fantasy.\" Prof Charles Swanton, the chairman of the conference, said targeted liposomes were a \"holy grail of nanomedicine\". He added: \"These studies demonstrate for the first time how they can be built to include a temperature control, which could open up a range of new treatment avenues. \"This is still early work but these liposomes could be an effective way of targeting treatment towards cancer cells while leaving healthy cells unharmed.\" Follow James on Twitter.", "question": "Scientists have designed microscopic \" grenades \" that can @placeholder their cancer - killing payload in tumours .", "option_0": "enjoy", "option_1": "replicate", "option_2": "put", "option_3": "explode", "option_4": "overcome", "label": 3}

{"article": "The horsemeat scandal has shown how complex the UK's meat supply chain has become, and it also highlights how little retailers and customers alike know what is actually going into the food that we eat. Meat represents 14% of a household's weekly food purchases on average, according to a 2012 report from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). While data from Defra's Family Food report shows there has been little change in the proportion of meat people have been buying in the UK for decades, there is a marked difference in the type of meat being purchased. The quantity of ready meals and convenience meat products - including kebabs and chicken kievs - the British public bought increased by 480% from 1974 through to 2011. That stands in stark contrast to weekly household purchases of fresh cuts of meat, such as lamb, mutton, pork, beef and veal, which have all experienced noticeable drops. The Family Food report figures show chicken became a more popular meat than beef for the first time in 1988 during the BSE crisis - when the public boycotted British beef after a link was established between BSE carried by infected cattle and the human form of the disease, CJD. Purchases of ready-made burgers - which were the original focus of the horsemeat scandal - have been relatively consistent over time. Italian food passed English to become the biggest selling ready meal cuisine in 2011, with sales of Â£406m. The UK market for chilled and frozen ready meals is valued at Â£1.85bn and grew 6.6% in 2011, according to market research company Key Note. But the market was rocked after horsemeat was found in some frozen lasagne and spaghetti Bolognese products this month, including some Findus beef lasagne products which were found to contain 100% horsemeat. Price is the most important factor for shoppers when they are deciding which foods to buy, according to Defra's 2012 Food Statistics Pocketbook. More than 40% of customers said it is the most important factor, with 90% listing it in their top five. Food prices have risen by 12% in real terms since 2007 and, after years of price falls, are now back up to 1997 levels. That has resulted in those in low income households cutting back on fruit, vegetables and meat like beef, pork and lamb, Defra says. Food writer Rose Prince compared the horsemeat revelations to the BSE crisis of the 1980s and thinks the current crisis will lead to a lack of trust from the public in convenience food. \"We've come to believe religiously in convenience food without thinking too much about where it comes from because we trust suppliers and retailers,\" she said. \"What we're seeing now is as a result of the constant drive to keep food prices low.\"", "question": "Walk through any big supermarket or corner shop in the @placeholder and convenience foods , from microwaveable meals to pre-cooked meat , are ubiquitous .", "option_0": "world", "option_1": "country", "option_2": "water", "option_3": "river", "option_4": "town", "label": 1}
{"article": "Over cucumber sandwiches at The Ritz with David Frost he had been offered a starring role in his new satirical TV programme, The Frost Report. Suddenly freed from his duties as Will Scarlett, it was Corbett's big break in TV and paired him up with another performer, Ronnie Barker. And why had Frost chosen Corbett?  He had seen him in a show in a London nightclub with Danny La Rue. There, in one story, is one of the main reasons Ronnie Corbett was such a popular performer - acting, revue, the 1960s satire boom, music hall - he brought it all together at the right time and the right place in one five-foot-one performer. The Two Ronnies survived on the BBC because it had a breadth of comedy that gave it a startling breadth of appeal.  Those '60s connections also helped - a number of those cocktail party sketches were written by Terry Jones and Michael Palin.  The show's place at the heart of the Saturday night schedule meant it attracted the best writers. There's also another factor - I once met Ronnie Corbett in a lift in BBC Television Centre.  He was a bit lost (something that happened to everyone at one time or another) and we went up and down more than once trying to work out where he had just come from. Meeting a childhood hero in a lift is always going to be a bit surreal, but what struck me was that he was entirely like the person I had seen on the television - he was good natured, self-deprecating and great company. Watching him in public you noticed how he seemed to arrive with a little aura of good cheer.  Perhaps the height helped, but he didn't have to say much to lighten the mood and that ability to be charming and affable was perhaps a key reason why his comic partnership lasted so long. In 16 years of The Two Ronnies, Corbett could only remember one argument.  Given that Ronnie Barker was a man of high standards and strong views that is an extraordinary achievement as the history of double acts is peppered with stories of partnerships that are less than friendly off-stage. It might have been different if Corbett had been fighting to get his material on the show, but they avoided that bear trap. Barker contributed his sketches under the pseudonym of Gerald Wiley to ensure it was used on merit - indeed Corbett once set about trying to find Wiley because he wanted to use one of his sketches in his stage show. Even the famous armchair monologues which just sound like Corbett's own stream of consciousness were written by Spike Mullins and One Foot in the Grave writer, David Renwick. What Ronnie Corbett brought was the skill of a great performer - utterly convincing, always funny and likeable.", "question": "It was one of the West End 's great disasters .

{"article": "There are many things about it that have attracted comment from US columnists to the blogosphere: that he oversaw such controversial and costly wars but should ultimately fall on a matter of personal behaviour; that President Barack Obama was not apparently informed until election day that Gen Petraeus was under investigation by the FBI; and that the issue is now drawing in more people, including General John Allen, who replaced Gen Petraeus as the commander of Nato forces in Afghanistan. The inquiry resulted from complaints by a woman that she had received threatening e-mails from Paula Broadwell, Gen Petraeus' biographer and for several months apparently also his lover. The FBI investigation is now moving on to issues such as whether the author had unauthorised access to classified material. Some have written of the general's vanity, suggesting he liked to be surrounded by admiring staffers, academics and indeed journalists. Having met and interviewed him several times, I can certainly confirm that he took particular care of his image (for example preferring to be filmed favouring the patch on his right shoulder - the combat one of the 101st Airborne Division, which he commanded during the 2003 invasion of Iraq), and that lately his staff tried hard to discourage challenging lines of questioning, whereas during our earlier meetings he had proven more than happy to tackle whatever we threw at him. It was during one of these later meetings with Gen Petraeus that he introduced me to Mrs Broadwell, who at that time was working on her book about him and with whom, it emerged last week, he was having an affair. I will not pretend that I had any great presentiment or intuition about what was going on, but did note that during our off-camera conversations, he and I reflected in a humorous way on the ageing process and how it played out in men. Gen Petraeus had gone through cancer treatment in 2009 and it is in this context that a friend of his, a fellow general, sought to explain to me today what had happened: \"Almost everyone considered him to be immortal, but he had been shaken by the cancer business and continually deployed for five-and-a-half years.\" The same officer concluded that while his friend was right to offer his resignation once the extramarital affair with Ms Broadwell had come to light, that \"the president shouldn't have accepted it\". Some reports today suggest that the CIA director did not even himself feel it was a resigning matter, but was persuaded to write the letter by the Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper. The head of the wider US intelligence community apparently felt it would not be possible for Gen Petraeus to discipline CIA staff accused of marital indiscretions, if he had shown himself fallible in the same regard. General Stan McChrystal, Gen Petraeus' predecessor as Nato commander in Kabul, also suffered a public fall from grace in 2010, stepping down after staff members were quoted by Rolling Stone magazine being critical about the Obama administration. Some used a similar formula at the time, about the president not needing to accept a tendered resignation. Both generals had been lionised in the US press and in Congress, particularly for reversing the slide to civil war in Iraq. It is also true to say that many of the commanders, including British as well as American, whom I have spoken to in Iraq and Afghanistan were completely in awe of these two men and their abilities. As for what they achieved in their attempt to replicate the success of the Iraq surge in Afghanistan, that is a different matter, for many now consider it to have failed. That two commanders who wielded power of life and death over so many, and were widely praised as soldier-scholars, should fall on issues of PR and an affair is itself a stark measure of the degree to which personal failings that might once have been kept private can now be the decisive factors in professional ruin. And how serious are the charges that led to their fall? The FBI cleared the CIA boss of any involvement with sending threatening emails, even if he still has serious issues to address with his wife Holly Petraeus. And an inquiry into Gen McChrystal's conduct towards the Rolling Stone reporter exonerated him of any misconduct. Some once talked of Gen Petraeus - his physical fitness, charging intellect, and devotion to duty in almost super-human terms.

{"article": "I doubt, for example, that any of Scotland's fine panto producers are this very moment picking up the phone to Phillip Hammond to offer him a comic role. Perhaps it was Mr Hammond's pre-existing reputation for dry delivery - but he appeared to feel the need to deploy a few gags. Some, including the one satirising Boris Johnson, were not at all bad. But, more generally, the presentation was relatively straitlaced. So much so, indeed, that the Chancellor was obliged to ad lib to tell Tory backbenchers that he had just announced good, if complex, news. It was time, he plainly felt, for them to cheer. So the tone was relatively straightforward, even sombre - despite the gags. And understandably so. For if Mr Hammond isn't Abanazar - hiss, boo - he isn't Wishee Washee either. He told it as it is. Or, more precisely, he told it as the OBR forecasts suggest, independently, that it will be. Higher borrowing, lower tax revenues. And above all a growth potential that is some 2.4% lower than it might have been, according to the selfsame OBR, without the Brexit vote. A referendum outcome which means that the forecasts are described as uncertain - that is, compared to the shot in the dark to which we have become accustomed of late. In summary, the outlook is for an economy which will be some Â£122bn worse off by 2020 than previously forecast. In the face of that, the Chancellor talked of \"resilience\". A capacity to cope. An ability to rise to the challenge. He was keen to stress the underlying strength of the UK economy. But he did not duck those challenges lying ahead. In essence, he was trying to pre-empt the prospect of any further weakening in the economic outlook by adding a degree of stimulus while trying, he said, to address a longer-term problem. The stimulus will come from capital investment, funded by borrowing and by tax changes. That longer-term question is the issue of relatively low UK productivity. An innovation fund will be deployed in an effort to find solutions to what Mr Hammond depicted as a systemic problem in the UK. Capital investment and, even more so, any attempt to transform the integral nature of the UK economic structure will take time to produce results in terms of growth and jobs. Perhaps, perhaps, handily coinciding with the forward uncertainty forecast by the OBR. For Scotland, ministers had been privately anxious that the entire revenue settlement for the year ahead, 2017/18, might be unpicked, with adverse consequences. That has not happened - and there will be a degree of relief at Holyrood, albeit the spending constraints remain in place. Then there is the extra money for capital investment as a Barnett consequential of the spending south of the border. It adds up to Â£800m - and, when announced, Tory backbenchers joined in a panto-style vocal challenge to the SNP benches. Rejoice, they appeared to be shouting, rejoice. To be clear, the capital spending allocated to the Scottish government will be welcomed by ministers. However, they note that it is spread over four years, from the current 2016/17. They argue further that, taking all the figures into account, there remains a cut of about 8% in capital spending in real terms over the extended period from the Conservatives first entering Downing Street in 2010.

{"article": "It ought to be. After all, this is the first Conservative budget in almost 20 years. The last was delivered by Ken Clarke in 1996. It has to deliver promises repeated for so long but yet to be delivered, like the cut to inheritance tax. It has to fulfil the Tories' stated goals of cutting spending, cutting welfare and cutting tax whilst still claiming to be the \"workers' party\" pursuing a One Nation \"we're all in it together\" philosophy. And it comes at a time when what politicians love to call \"difficult decisions\" will never be easier to take. After all, George Osborne no longer has to haggle with coalition partners, he faces a Labour Party which is still struggling to absorb its defeat and he is once again able to raise the spectre of Greece - \"if a country's not in control of its borrowing the borrowing takes control of the country\". Nevertheless, the chancellor is expected to slow the pace of planned welfare cuts so that he will take three years instead of two to reach his promised target of £12bn. I understand he will unveil proposals for £8bn of cuts by 2017/8 and a further £4bn by 2018/9. Sources are stressing that this is very unlikely to make the cuts less controversial or to stop what Mr Osborne has called the \"depressingly predictable howls of protest\" which he expects to greet his Budget. In the last Parliament the deepest welfare cuts the government achieved amounted to £8bn over two years and experts have pointed out that the easy routes to saving money have already been taken - for example, ending the link between benefit rises and the higher RPI rate of inflation. The main targets for welfare cuts are expected to be tax credits - in particular child tax credit - housing benefit and the elements of Employment Support Allowance which are paid to those deemed capable of work related activity (my colleagues Allegra Stratton and Michael Buchanan have examined these in depth). The chancellor may also choose to slow the pace of overall spending cuts, although the Treasury is refusing to confirm this. This would be seen as a response to criticism from the Office for Budget Responsibility after the last Budget of what they described as a \"roller coaster\" ride in public spending - sharp cuts for two years followed by steep rises. The OECD has also called on the government to reconsider plans to front-load spending cuts at the beginning of this Parliament. Some forecasters have suggested that the deficit could be as much as £15bn lower than it was forecast to be just three months ago when George Osborne last delivered a Budget. This would allow him a little bit of wriggle room to slow his spending cuts at the same time as pursuing tax cuts, particularly if he can also raise significant sums by increasing the tax paid by non-doms and by top-rate taxpayers on their pension contributions. Mr Osborne will, as expected, reject calls for him to cut the top rate of income tax from 45p to 40p and will instead make further progress towards the Tories' target of increasing the personal income tax allowance to £12,500 and the threshold for higher rate tax to £50,000. If he does all this and more the Budget will certainly live up to the pre-billing. Which word you add after \"big\" will, of course, depend on your political persuasion.", "question": "\" Big.

{"article": "Bavuma, 25, became the first black African to score a Test hundred for South Africa as he hit an unbeaten 102 against England in Cape Town. Hashim Amla scored a double century as the hosts declared on 627-7, with England ending day four 18 runs ahead. \"I'm full of emotion, relief and I'm very satisfied,\" said Bavuma. Speaking to BBC Test Match Special, he added: \"Luckily with the team environment we have it wasn't all about the runs I scored that enabled me to have a sense of belonging. \"But I think for myself it really gives me that boost of confidence to say that I can truly play at this level.\" England all-rounder Ben Stokes appeared to be caught on television coverage sledging Bavuma early in the South African's innings. Bavuma told a post-match news conference that he respected \"tough competitor\" Stokes for congratulating him after the game on reaching his milestone. \"He did come hard, but everything was in the spirit of the game,\" he said. \"Some of things he said I couldn't really hear him, but the more he kept on speaking, it fired me a bit more to knuckle down and focus on the task in hand.\" Prior to this match, Bavuma had amassed just 145 runs at an average of 20.71 in six Tests since making his debut against West Indies in December 2014. Arriving at the crease under pressure as the Proteas lost three wickets for 10 runs after lunch, the diminutive batsman played with impressive fluency, driving through the covers and pulling anything short to the boundary. Bavuma, born in the Langa township in Cape Town, raced to his half century off just 52 balls before reaching three figures late in the day in front of an elated home crowd. \"There was a lot of noise and I think people were probably just as jubilated or as satisfied as I was,\" he added. \"My parents were watching and I'm sure it was also a special moment for them. I had a couple of friends that kept making noise, so I think the moment was greatly shared by the people as well as myself. \"Our mindset was just to bat time, try to occupy most of the day and luckily we got into a position where we were able to shift pressure on to England. \"Unfortunately we didn't get that wicket that we wanted late on but on Wednesday we hope to get a couple of wickets and get the English guys scrambling out there.\" The tourists dropped eight catches of varying difficulty across South Africa's marathon 211-over innings, including Bavuma on 77 when wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow failed to claim an edge behind low to his right. England assistant coach Paul Farbrace admits those mistakes have probably cost his side victory on a flat wicket but hopes they can \"send out a statement\" for the rest of the series on the final day on Wednesday. \"We didn't expect to be in this position on day four and honestly if we'd taken our chances through the two days then we wouldn't be in this position,\" he added. \"Our bowlers have created great opportunities, which on a flat pitch is all you can do - one or two were half-chances and that's tough but one or two others we should've caught and we're disappointed we haven't. \"You don't want to highlight it to the extent you're saying 'don't drop catches' to them because obviously any tension in the body makes it harder so it's a case of lots of repetitive catching and working incredibly hard. \"I'm sure our bowlers in the ice bath after the day will say it's a flat wicket but it's not it's not a terrible pitch for Test match cricket by any means because chances have been created - we've shown that if you get the ball in the right place there has been a little bit there.\"", "question": "South Africa batsman Temba Bavuma says his historic maiden Test century has @placeholder his place at international level after a tough year .", "option_0": "taken", "option_1": "proved", "option_2": "booked", "option_3": "justified", "option_4": "died", "label": 3}
{"article": "BBC Sport takes a look at the stories you may have missed from Saturday's action. Forty years ago this week a raw, no-nonsense 18-year-old centre-back by the name of Mick McCarthy was making his debut for Barnsley in a 4-0 win over Rochdale. The Ipswich Town manager had been marking that football landmark in fine style, until Saturday's 2-0 home defeat against Fulham put an end to his side's 100% start to the league season. Following an impressive playing career at club and international level with the Republic of Ireland, the Yorkshireman has been in charge for almost 900 matches in the top two tiers of English football, as well as leading his adopted country to the last 16 of the 2002 World Cup. But it is the man whose boots he used to clean who now boasts the only perfect record in the Championship. Can you spot McCarthy's fellow Championship manager below? McCarthy, 58, was a certain Neil Warnock's apprentice during his early years at the Tykes and, incredibly, between them they have managed more than one-third of the teams currently in England's second tier. Warnock's Cardiff City lead the way on their own now, with five wins from five thanks to a 2-1 success against QPR. And here's a quiz question bonus for you. Can you name the nine second-tier sides the pair have managed? Answers at the bottom of the page. After a total of 439 minutes* spanning more than four and a half league and cup games this season, Gillingham finally scored a goal on Saturday. In fact they got three. Well, Tom Eaves did to be precise, netting a hat-trick - and his first goals for the club - inside 24 second-half minutes. Eaves' efforts saw the Gills twice come from behind to earn a 3-3 draw against Southend United. Not to be outdone by Eaves, Newport County's Frank Nouble also grabbed a hat-trick - marking his home debut in style as his side beat Chesterfield 4-1. Coming through the ranks at Chelsea, the Exiles are Nouble's 13th British club, with a brief spell in China sandwiched in between. The South Wales air certainly seems to agree with him. Maybe his treble will help the much-travelled 25-year-old forward settle? *Not counting Gillingham's 0-0 draw on the final day of last season, or the 25 goalless minutes in the game before that. Every new signing dreams of scoring on their debut, but Burton Albion loanee Joe Mason took that to the next level in his side's 1-1 draw with Sheffield Wednesday. Not only did the striker equalise for the Brewers, he did so only 31 seconds after being brought on at the Pirelli Stadium. Seconds after jogging on, Mason was allowed space in the area to shoot on the turn, converting after Gary Hooper had put the visitors ahead with a close-range backheel. Mason had not scored since January. How is he going to follow up that first impression? Grimsby Town's players are either very unlucky or need to brush up on the laws of the game following their fifth red card in five matches this season. Danny Collins was guilty of two bookable offences in the Mariners' 3-2 home defeat against Wycombe after a handball in the penalty area and a bad foul on Matt Bloomfield. Early baths for Ben Davies, Sam Jones, James Berrett and Zak Mills in the four previous league and cup matches mean Collins' dismissal kept up the unwanted 100% record. Grimsby now find themselves third from bottom in League Two and will hope to move themselves back up the table before they run out of available players. Northampton Town's start to a season seemingly so full of promise has been miserable to say the least. With Matt Crooks and Matt Grimes headlining a host of summer signings, hopes were high for a positive campaign in League One. Four games in and Justin Edinburgh's side are one of only two teams in the EFL yet to register a single point. Saturday's 4-1 home loss against high-flying Peterborough United means the rock-bottom Cobblers have now lost all four league matches, conceding 10 goals and scoring two. Under-pressure boss Edinburgh told BBC Radio Northampton: \"We are in this together. We will never isolate anybody. We have let ourselves down, we have let the fans down and the football club. I accept all the responsibility. \"I have had to work hard in my career as a player and a manager and I am not going to give it up lightly. \"If we are going to get the result that we need we certainly have to defend better than we have. We were so, so poor in the goals we gave away. I understand the frustration but the only way you get through it is by sticking together.\" At least the Cobblers are not alone at the foot of the third tier. Oldham Athletic's 2-1 loss to Blackpool means they also have no points but remain above Northampton on goal difference. Did you get the nine Championship clubs managed by either Mick McCarthy or Neil Warnock? They are: Cardiff, Ipswich, Wolves, Leeds, QPR, Sheffield United, Sunderland, Millwall and Burton.

{"article": "He grew up there with a family so poor, they often went to bed having only drunk warm water for dinner. To earn money, he dropped out of school as a teenager to fight at local fiestas for a winning purse of 100 pesos, or less than $4 (Â£2.60). In a sign of how far he's come, this weekend he earned at least $100m in the \"fight of the century\" against American rival Floyd \"Money\" Mayweather Jr. The highly anticipated bout took about half a decade to organise and is the richest event in the history of boxing. Pacquiao wasn't able to defeat Mayweather. Despite his loss, the 36-year-old remains a hero in locals' eyes and there is speculation he may turn to politics and possibly run for president in the coming years. Following his sporting success, he's become so influential in the Philippines it can be said that he single-handedly boosts the economy each time he fights. Some analysts have gone so far as to claim the Philippines' currency the peso rises ahead of his matches. One media report said the peso strengthened against the US dollar in six out of 10 of his last critical fights. Whenever Pacquiao enters the ring, the South East Asian nation is famously said to come to a virtual standstill. This past weekend was no different. The normally gridlocked streets of its capital, Manila, stood mostly empty in the hours leading up to and during his match against Mayweather. Across the country, millions gathered in private homes, town halls, schools, cinemas and stadiums to watch him fight across the Pacific, cheering loudly each time he managed to land a blow on his arch rival. It is estimated that seven out of 10 people in the Philippines watched the match on Sunday. And that level of viewership translates into a lot of money. Tickets to the match at the MGM Grand Garden in Vegas officially ranged from $1,500 to $10,000. They were sold out in minutes. In the Philippines, most people would never be able to afford that. It is estimated that more than a quarter of its population live under the poverty line, or with less than $2 a day. However, many paid out of pocket to watch the Pacquiao-Mayweather match at home, a bar, hotel or casino, and a variety of businesses have cashed in. Sky Cable charged a pay-per-view rate of 2,500 pesos. Others paid 800 pesos per head to watch Sunday's fight in a cinema. Operator SM Prime Holdings said it sold 100,000 tickets for showings in 200 of its 300 cinemas. Even the Philippines' biggest power distributor Manila Electric (Meralco) benefited. It said electricity usage is about 10% higher during Pacquiao fights. On the islands of Palawan and Mindanao, residents were advised to turn off their refrigerators to save electricity ahead of the match due to intermittent power outages. Then there are the lucrative sponsorship deals. When Pacquiao first went professional, he only had one advertiser willing to pay for their logo to feature on his trunks. In Las Vegas on Sunday, they generated about $2.5m after at least six companies paid for a space on his shorts, including Philippines telecoms giant Smart Communications. It's also impossible to escape his mug in the sprawling capital of Manila; its plastered on flyers in shopping malls and in multiple sections of the daily newspapers. Brands such as Nike, Rexona and Nestle's Butterfinger Peanut Butter Cups also hawk merchandise with his name or likeness on them. Small businesses have benefited from the \"Pac Man effect\" as well. In a small shopping mall in Quezon City, a suburb of Manila, the Bunny Baker cafÃ© has seen an increase in traffic after its owners created a life-sized cake of the boxer. \"I think Pacquiao is phenomenal for the economy,\" co-owner Zach Yonzon said. \"Whenever there is a fight, everybody goes out. If you're not watching at home, you're going outside to eat at a restaurant. \"When Filipinos are happy, they spend money,\" he added with a smile. The biggest and simplest way Pacquiao contributes to the local economy is through taxes. As one of the world's most highly-paid athletes, Pacquiao is the Philippines' top individual taxpayer despite having been accused of under-declaring his income. He drew $42m in earnings last year, according to Forbes, a figure that will exponentially increase following his fight with Mayweather. Their bout was the richest in boxing history having generated as much as half-a-billion dollars. Pacquiao, who dropped out of high school aged 14, has also demonstrated business savvy over the years. In General Santos, known as the country's tuna capital because of its fishing industry, Pacquiao has set up a gym and hotel, where you can buy an \"8 World Title\" or \"Pound for Pound\" Pacquiao burger at its Roadhaus restaurant. The poverty that Pacquiao famously grew up in is long gone. Now he lives in large mansions and will never go hungry again. And that's why he has captured the Philippines' consciousness. His is the true Cinderella story, and millions of Filipinos still aspire to emulate his escape from grinding poverty and make their own mark on the world stage.", "question": "In the southern Philippines city of General Santos , there is a dusty little barangay , or village , where boxer Manny \" Pac Man \" Pacquiao recalls having @placeholder in the streets , starving and hungry .", "option_0": "rooted", "option_1": "names", "option_2": "slept", "option_3": "spots", "option_4": "fallen", "label": 2}
{"article": "The boiled and peeled eggs were mainly sold to cafeterias, cafes and catering firms, the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration said in a statement. Denmark is the latest European country to discover eggs contaminated with fipronil in its food chain. The insecticide can damage people's kidneys, liver and thyroid glands if eaten in large quantities. However, the Danish food administration urged calm, saying the eggs bought by DanÃ¦g Products posed no risk to human consumption. \"Samples analysed in the Netherlands show traces of fipronil in the eggs, but not as a health hazard,\" the agency said [in Danish]. \"Because the content is illegal, DanÃ¦g Products must withdraw the eggs from their customers.\" Twenty tonnes is the equivalent weight of two-and-a-half African elephants. Denmark is believed to be the tenth country affected by the widening scandal, with Romania and Luxembourg among the latest to report finding contaminated products. The majority of the eggs have originated from the Netherlands, but also from Belgium and Germany. Romanian authorities said on Thursday that one tonne of liquid egg yolk contaminated with fipronil had been found in a warehouse in the west of the country. The product was imported from Germany but had not been sold to consumers, food safety officials said. It also emerged on Thursday that two managers at a Dutch company had been arrested during joint raids by Dutch and Belgian authorities. The company - named as Chickfriend by local media - allegedly used fipronil at poultry farms, prosecutors in the Netherlands said. Fipronil is banned from use in the food industry under EU rules. In a statement, the prosecutors said investigators were also focused on a Belgian supplier, and another Dutch company \"that colluded with the Belgian supplier\". They added: \"They are suspected of putting public health in danger by supplying and using fipronil in pens containing egg-laying chickens.\" Chickfriend, a poultry farm cleaning company, is yet to comment. Investigators in Belgium have also carried out several raids and identified 26 people or companies as suspects, AFP news agency reports. Some 6,000 litres of \"prohibited products\" were seized in Belgium. In the UK, the Food Standards Agency now says about 700,000 eggs have been imported from potentially contaminated Dutch farms, up from an early estimate of 21,000, But it said it was very unlikely that there was a risk to public health. However, 11 products containing egg - including sandwiches and salads - have been withdrawn from supermarkets. The Netherlands is Europe's biggest egg producer - and one of the largest exporters of eggs and egg products in the world. Some 180 farms - which produce millions of eggs a week - have been temporarily shut down while further tests are carried out. It is thought that fipronil was added to an allowable treatment for red mites. The problem first surfaced earlier in August, when Aldi withdrew all its eggs from sale in Germany. It has since emerged Belgian officials knew about the contamination in June, but did not make the information public because of a fraud investigation. But Belgium has in turn accused the Dutch of knowing about the problem as far back as November 2016, which they deny.", "question": "Twenty tonnes of insecticide - @placeholder eggs have been sold in Denmark , the country 's food safety authority says .", "option_0": "tainted", "option_1": "monitored", "option_2": "free", "option_3": "levels", "option_4": "based", "label": 0}

The story - titled The Pilot - introduces the Doctor's new companion Bill Potts, played by Pearl Mackie. It sees the Doctor, Bill, and Nardole, played by Matt Lucas, battling a shape-shifting alien across time and space. Capaldi, 58, who took over the Time Lord role in 2013, announced in January that he would leave the show in the 2017 Christmas special. Speaking to an invited audience at the screening in London on Tuesday, Capaldi said: \"It's an incredible thing to wake up in the morning and go 'Oh, I'm still Doctor Who!' and go and blow up some monsters - and that's how you spend your day. \"When you walk around, people don't see Peter anymore - it's Doctor Who they see  - and he gets many more smiles than I do.

{"article": "You'd be forgiven for missing the tiny dirt track that veers off toward the Westgate farm in Chisamba, which grows moringa trees. There is a humble entrance to a modest plot of land, but it houses a project with huge aspirations. \"I personally think we can wipe out malnutrition in Zambia, in sub-Saharan Africa or anywhere else there is a malnutrition problem\" says Steven Putter, executive director of the Imagine Rural Development Initiative, which has been planting moringa trees on this site in Zambia since 2013. Moringa has been used for centuries in Asia and Africa for its nutritional and healing properties, and in some reports it has been called \"the miracle tree\" and \"the tree of life\". The delicate green leaves and even the stems of the plant are packed with vitamins, amino acids, anti-oxidants and protein. A chance encounter introduced Steven Putter to this unassuming shrub. He was so taken with the plant's potential that he abandoned a corporate career in South Africa and moved to Zambia. He set up the project with $250,000 (£170,000) of his own funds, the help of another investor, and a $20,000 grant from the Swedish government. Putter's vision is that moringa supplements could have a revolutionary effect in Zambia where malnutrition rates are some of the worst in Africa. About 45% of Zambian children under five suffer stunted growth, says the World Health Organisation - while the children's charity, Unicef, says that thousands of children and women suffer from one or more forms of malnutrition, including low birth weight, stunting and multiple vitamin deficiencies. \"I'm not saying moringa is the only plant, but it's a very good cornerstone to relieve the problems that exist now very quickly,\" says Steven. \"Imagine if we plant 1,000 trees at every school in Zambia, that would probably cost $2m - but what is that in relation to being able to wipe out malnutrition?\" Lewis Chikoti's bright green overall stands out amongst the knee-high moringa crops he is tending. He joined the project as farm foreman a year ago and now feeds his children moringa three times a day: \"I have noticed such a difference in my family's health; my children are not getting sick and they just seem brighter with more energy.\" Most people in Zambia rely on a diet of the maize staple nshima, which is easy to grow, but is of little nutritional value. \"With maize you get food security, which is good because it puts a plate of food in front of people\" says Steven Putter, \"but the language needs to change from 'food security' to 'nutritional security'.\" Moringa oil was prized in perfume manufacture in ancient Egypt, classical Greece, and the Roman empire. The drought-resistant plant is also known by names including drumstick tree and horseradish tree. It's mainly grown for its leaves in Africa, and its pods in Asia. As a food, its leaves are rich in protein, minerals and vitamins A, B and C. Moringa flowers are used to make tea, and mature seeds can be roasted and eaten like peanuts. The plant can also be used as an animal feed. Moringa seed powder has anti-bacterial properties, and can be used during water purification. Source: Feedipedia Zambia is also in desperate need of re-structuring its economy and lessening its dependence on mining. Copper mining accounts for over 70% of the country's exports, yet the lion's share of copper mines are foreign-owned and many ordinary Zambians say they are not feeling the benefits. Austen Ngwani looks after the moringa project's accounts. Originally from the Copperbelt region in the north west of the country, he feels strongly about Zambia's need to diversify. \"For Zambia to develop, we need to move away from the mining sector and look to agriculture,\" he says. \"It's the only way we can export on our own terms and strengthen our currency.\" Steven Putter says the numbers add up for Zambia. Moringa plants can be harvested once a month. In peak season and on the Zambian site, it requires no fertilizer. This contributes to a very high return on investment, says Mr Putter, of up to \"$60,000 per hectare per year\". So far the project employs 60 people tending six million plants. Moringa products such as tea or food supplements are sold within Zambia and exported to other countries including the UK, China and South Africa. Putter wants to expand the site to include animal husbandry and aquaponics - using water tanks to grow plants and breed fish. He says the results of giving moringa to animals is quite amazing. \"We have seen a 15% increase in cattle growth since introducing moringa to their diet\".

{"article": "American chief executive Henry Engelhardt will hand over the keys in a year's time. Started in 1991, the company now employs 7,000 people, most of them in south Wales. Admiral's idea was to target motorists who found it hard to get cheaper insurance, including younger drivers, those with higher performance cars and those living in cities. Engelhardt initially looked at setting the business up in Brighton, as he wanted somewhere within two hours of London. \"Cardiff - we had to get the map out to find where it was,\" he said. But he was impressed by the \"sell\" of the old South Glamorgan County Council and a £1m set-up grant by the then Welsh Development Agency to settle on the Welsh capital for his headquarters. Admiral has seen record profits every year since it became a public company. Although 2014 was an exception, it still made a £357 million profit. Engelhardt has a taste for food analogies - following on from describing the company's performance as \"jacket potato\" (comforting - but not exciting like a steak) in 2013, 2014 was \"Baked Alaska\" (hot and cold in a single bite). In reality, Admiral is facing challenging times as competition in the insurance market drives down prices and makes it tougher to make a profit. It also operates price comparison site confused.com but the UK market has become \"saturated,\" in the words of Engelhardt, with few new customers. That is why Admiral is become increasingly focused on foreign markets such as the USA, Spain and France. The way the company does business has also attracted attention. \"People who like what they do, do it better\" is the company's philosophy. With that in mind, the firm has a Ministry of Fun, which organises events for staff including fancy dress days and pantomimes, while a community chest distributed £114,000 last year to charities and good causes staff were involved in outside work. The group also sponsors the Wales rugby team's shirts. Senior managers sit in open-plan offices with staff and they can email Engelhardt directly through the \"Ask Henry\" company intranet. Neither Engelhardt or his senior team have company cars. More seriously there is the share scheme for workers, with some long-serving staff receiving the equivalent of £30,000 in shares. In February, Admiral was placed number five in the Sunday Times 100 Best Companies to Work. FACTFILE - HENRY ENGELHARDT Mr Engelhardt, who owns 11.7% of the company, said he was leaving to make way for a younger management team to take the group forward. \"It's a transition - I'm probably starting a downward slope and we've a lot of managers on the upward slope.\" \"Don't bury me yet, Guys! I still have 12 months on the job and lots to accomplish in that time.\" His successor, co-founder David Stevens, 51, said he was ready to build on Mr Engelhardt's \"formidable legacy\" but is also talking with him about how he might continue to make his \"unique skills\" available.

{"article": "English is one of the advantages India has which are said to be propelling it to economic superpower status. There are all those Indians who speak excellent English. It's the mother tongue of the elite and effectively the official language of the central government. Then there is the growing number of parents who now aspire to give their children an education through the medium of that language. But is the craze for English an unmixed blessing? Back in the sixties the British regarded Indian English as something of a joke. The comic actor Peter Sellers had mocked it so comprehensively that I found it well nigh impossible to get the BBC to allow anyone with even the faintest Indian accent on the air. In India, we native English speakers laughed at quaint phrases like \"please do the necessary and oblige\", or more simply \"please do the needful\", and \"it is suggested that the meeting be preponed\", which appeared regularly in Indian official correspondence. A senior British diplomat once suggested that his PA should find some less geographically specific way of answering the telephone when he couldn't take the call than saying, \"Sahib is not on his seat\". Much to the diplomat's dismay a colleague told him that his PA had misunderstood the instruction and been even more specific. He'd told the colleague, \"Sahib is in the lavatory.\" Now with Indian writers carrying off the major literary awards, and Westerners in the IT and BPO industries talking of being \"bangalored\" when they are replaced by English-speaking Indians, Indian English is anything but a joke. But could the very success of English in India \"bangalore\" India's own languages? The linguist Professor David Crystal speaking in Delhi said: \"A language is dying every two weeks somewhere in the world today. Half the world's languages will no longer be spoken in another century. This is an extremely serious concern, and English has to share the blame.\" Others put it less politely, describing English as a killer language. But should India worry if English kills off some of its 22 officially recognised and hundreds of its not-so-official languages? Perhaps the answer is no. In his book comparing the future of India, China, and Japan, the former editor of The Economist, Bill Emmott, said India fell short of China in almost every measure except the ability to speak English. So why shouldn't India build on its one advantage? One practical reason is because, looking back over the history of India since it became independent in 1947, it is clear that any threat to Indian languages has the potential to provoke a violent backlash.

{"article": "Sorry, the pop songs tell us, is the hardest word - but is it ever enough? Libyan television showed Saadi Gaddafi in his blue prison uniform the other day, clean-shaven and looking well. The authorities were keen to dispel rumours that the 40-year-old - who led a colourful life as a son of the great dictator - had been abused in prison. He told the camera: \"I apologise to the Libyan people, and I apologise to the dear brothers in the Libyan government for all the harm I've caused and for disturbing the security and stability of Libya.\" There was no immediate indication that the \"dear brothers in the Libyan government\" would consider this adequate redress for the millions allegedly taken away by the former commander of Libya's Special Forces and former head of the Libyan Football Federation - but chances are they would not. What Zuma should say about Nkandla As we venture into April with all its anniversaries of history's gruesome moments - Rwanda 1994 or South Africa's removal of her apartheid yoke - how are we to understand the word \"sorry\" these days and more importantly does it count for anything at all? The steady stream of Africans appearing at the International Criminal Court (ICC) ignores the central theme of our African atrocities - that it is the little people, the men and women on the streets and in the hills of our villages who take the business of killing very personally. The events in the Central African Republic (CAR) have thrown up disturbing images of Christians targeting Muslims in revenge attacks. Young men have filled our news screens to happily declare that they want to kill, have killed and will kill again. African Union peacekeepers have been keeping a kind of peace where the Christians have refused to turn the other cheek and the UN has warned of the prospect of serious long-lasting conflict in the CAR. As we remember Rwanda's genocide, CAR reminds us that we have been here before - that the early warning alarms are ringing loud and clear and that sooner or later we shall hear the politicians convening truth and reconciliation commissions and the murdering Christians may have to say sorry not just in the confession box. But will it help? Collectively we all expect to hear the word sorry. A sorry from the great war-mongers of our times would not erase the wars, but it is expected. And so, as we remember the 1994 genocide, we are reminded about who has and has not apologised over the world's failure to stop the killings. In an interview over the weekend, Rwanda's President Paul Kagame mentioned \"the direct role of Belgium and France\" in the \"political preparation for genocide\" and repeated his claim that France did more than just \"not having done enough to save lives during the genocide\". France rejected such complicity, with a former prime minister saying the country took \"the initiative to organise a humanitarian operation to prevent widespread massacres\". The fall-out has been such that the French presidency at first suggested a boycott of Rwanda's 20th genocide memorial, then suggested they would be represented by their ambassador, only for that ambassador to say he had been barred from the ceremony. Apologies though, belong to the victims not to the victor - and there is a silent chapter in Rwanda's history that claims President Kagame's Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) troops killed thousands, including peacekeepers, in their pursuit of power and peace and that group of souls is too easily erased from his own narrative - accusations denied by Mr Kagame. All figures in 2013 financial terms Source: Public protector report How Zuma's home has grown Over in South Africa, where the country marks 20 years of democratic rule this month, President Jacob Zuma is about to go back to his country and ask for another term in office. And like all second-term presidents, the gloss has well and truly dimmed from his presidency and scandal after scandal hounds him. South Africans, though, always seem to be expecting Mr Zuma to apologise - for his past, his friends, his lovers, his money, his way of governance. Perhaps they have a taste for apologies following their Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which investigated human rights abuses carried out during the apartheid era and granted amnesty to those who showed remorse. Just the other week Mr Zuma was told that the millions of public money spent on security upgrades to his rural homestead in Nkandla could not be entirely justified and that he had to pay back some of the money spent on the swimming pool, the chicken enclosure and the amphitheatre. Public Protector Thuli Madonsela went further in her report on Nkandla: \"The manner in which the Nkandla Project was administered and implemented gave me the impression of a toxic concoction of a lack of leadership, a lack of control and focused self-interest.\" But those expecting an apology from the South African president may have a long wait - he has referred the whole matter to the Special Investigation Unit, leaving the nation to tuck into his latest dilemma as they prepare to go to the polls.

{"article": "So says Rafa from Brazil, as he and his friends dance lazily on the hill overlooking the huge main stage, where superstar DJ Avicii performs live. He is among thousands of Brazilians who made the 9,417km (5,000-mile) journey to Belgium for the Tomorrowland festival - a feast of electronic music. It's a very diverse crowd, with many people waving their national flags from all over the world: India, Australia, Russia, Germany, Chile, Canada, Spain, South Korea - pretty much anywhere. Despite being a relatively new festival Tomorrowland - staged in countryside between Brussels and Antwerp - has emerged as one of the biggest and most popular music events in the world. To mark its tenth anniversary the festival has added an extra weekend, doubling its usual capacity of 180,000 visitors. Despite the extension the 360,000 tickets were all sold out within an hour. Debby Wilmsen is a press agent for the festival, and she told me that although Tomorrowland started in 2005 with only 9,000 people attending, the festival's popularity continued to grow until they began selling out after five years. \"Now we have a new festival in the US called TomorrowWorld. It's all gone very fast for us.\" She says the secret to their success was a word-of-mouth reputation which all began on the internet. \"We do not make television or radio adverts, we don't print posters, we only use social media - so that we can have direct contact with our fans,\" she said. Tomorrowland's main stage has become an icon in itself, and its ambitious designs each year help to make the festival venue instantly recognisable around the world. In 2012 the stage was a huge volcano, erupting in fireworks. This year the stage is shaped like a giant water mill 140m (462ft) long and 40m high, surrounded by massive wheels and a huge round screen. Fire, smoke and confetti are blasted out from the stage, settling on the artistic \"valley\". The deep thumping bass follows you around the small town of Boom and the park hosting the event. The alleyways are full of happy festival-goers walking and dancing. There are 16 stages and 400 DJs, blasting out music non-stop. Whether you like electronic music or not, it is hard not to be swept up in the atmosphere. Along its eclectic, eccentric stages you'll find several lakes, a river running under a newly built bridge designed by a Belgian artist and a huge, slowly revolving wheel.  As night falls the lights from the stage and the colourful street artists create a magical atmosphere. Promoting local artists and products is an important part of the festival's ambitions. \"We have a lot of international guests coming here and we want to give them a touch of Belgian spirit. So we have Belgian fries, Belgian chefs cook meals in our restaurants and we have a Belgian beer cafe. We want to give visitors a holiday feeling with a real Belgian atmosphere,\" said Debby Wilmsen. The presence of drugs is a hard reality that all festivals must deal with, and Tomorrowland's policy is clear. \"Of course we cannot control everyone,  but we have police on site and we have a zero-tolerance policy. When someone is caught with drugs they are immediately expelled from the festival,\" she said. On the main stage the DJ asks the crowd to put their hands in the air and in seconds countless thousands of arms reach for the sky. Ronnie and Shani, two friends from Israel, can't stop smiling as they dance together. \"We are so happy to be here, we almost didn't make it. Our flight got cancelled because of the war [between Israel and Hamas] and we had to buy new tickets at the last minute. The only flights we could get on were to Paris, so we rented a car and here we are,\" says Shani. Ronnie says \"everybody is so friendly - it's nice to break away from the tense situation in our country at the moment\". As the sun sets on the fields of Boom, DJ Avicii finishes his set with his best-selling hit Wake Me Up. Rafa and his Brazilian friends sip beers as the festival reaches its finale. \"I would like to tell my children that I was here. It's something very unique, and I hope that in the future I'll be able send my son to Tomorrowland,\" Rafa says.", "question": "\" This is a dream come true , I feel like I 've jumped inside my television because in Brazil my friends and I would always watch Tomorrowland 's @placeholder and we always wanted to come here .

{"article": "And even in an era before the collapse of trust in politicians, the word \"non-political\" carried a lot of weight. A similar dynamic has been at play during the European Union referendum campaign. Both sides have been keen to roll out business leaders to support their cause, believing that voters are willing to listen to people who actually make decisions on employing people and investing in the UK economy. For Remain, a series of business big-hitters have backed the UK staying in the EU, saying leaving would risk job losses and threaten economic growth. How trade and the UK's economy are affected by membership of the EU. They include Sir Roger Carr, chairman of the aerospace giant BAE, Dame Carolyn McCall, chief executive of easyJet, Bob Dudley, chief executive of BP, and Douglas Flint, the chairman of HSBC. Remain supporters insist that the weight of business opinion is on their side. And certainly nearly all the reputable polls on the issue have put business support for Remain ahead of support for Leave. Today's by the British Chambers of Commerce, one of the largest, puts \"Remain\" leading \"Leave\" among its members 54% to 37%. Leave supporters respond by saying that larger businesses tend to be more pro-EU and speak for the \"establishment\", smaller businesses and those that do not export to other parts of the EU are more negative and that they have some significant business voices on their side. They include Tim Martin, chairman of pub chain JD Wetherspoons, Luke Johnson, chairman of Patisserie Valerie and the man behind the success of Pizza Express, and Rocco Forte, chief executive of Rocco Forte Hotels. And one ray of sunshine for the Leave campaign from the BCC survey is that the poll lead for remain among businesses has fallen from 30% to 17%. Though it is also worth noting that 90% of those that responded to the poll said that their mind was now settled, which suggests there is not much chance of a substantial further shift before the referendum on 23rd June. The BCC survey, and today's study by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research - which is expected to claim a high economic cost if Britain leaves the EU - kicks off another week where the economy will dominate much of the EU debate. On Wednesday George Osborne appears before the Treasury Select Committee to be questioned on the Treasury report which said that the UK economy could be 6% smaller by 2030 if Britain left the EU. On Thursday the Governor of the Bank of England will appear in public for one of the last major economic reports from the Bank on the state of the UK economy before the referendum.

The week will be rounded off by the International Monetary Fund's annual study of the British economy which is set to say that leaving the EU will carry a significant bill for Britain.

The tax bill covered was for Â£2.8m but the full value of the painting has not been disclosed. Owned by the same family since the 17th Century, the portrait will now go to the Bowes Museum in County Durham. Adrian Jenkins, director of the Bowes Museum at Barnard Castle, said: \"We are delighted to have the opportunity to celebrate the gift of this wonderful portrait. \"It will also of course enhance the museum's permanent collection.\" Born in Antwerp, Van Dyck  is thought of as one of the most important Flemish painters, in particular portraitists, of the 17th Century. He was heavily influenced by Rubens and the Italian artists, especially Titian, and is best remembered for his elegant representations of Charles I and his court after he settled at the English court in 1632. Olivia Porter was a lady-in-waiting at the court, who married Van Dyck's friend Endymion Porter, the king's picture agent and diplomat. The portrait of Olivia - who became the subject of more than one of the artist's portraits - is thought to have been commissioned by her husband. Its quality and vibrancy reflect the close friendship of the couple with the artist.

The problem is that the X Factor culture we live in today insinuates that success happens instantly for the super-talented. It is about overnight stardom, instant gratification. It deludes us into thinking that if we are blessed with genius, we need only step up to the line to become a superstar. In other words, the entire focus is upon the tip of the iceberg. But that is not how success really happens. Not in the real world, and certainly not in the Olympics. We need to focus more upon what is beneath the water line because only then will we have the resilience to journey towards our own potential, whether we are Olympians or anything else. If success is a sprint, then why bother to carry on when we haven't reached the top in the first few weeks? Might as well give up and try something else. If we recognise that success is a marathon, however, we are able to draw upon deeper reserves of energy and inspiration, and we have a much greater capacity to deal with the setbacks, challenges and failures that are an inevitable part of life and learning, and can sustain our motivation for far longer. This is sometimes called growth mindset - the idea that what we get out is ultimately about what we put in. Talent may be important, but it is never enough without application. Growth mindset recognises that the deepest question we face is: what are we doing beneath the waterline? That mindset has propelled many of our greatest Olympians, and has kept them going when others fell by the wayside. It is the questing spirit that is so central not just to the modern Games, but to its ancient incarnation, too. It is the spirit that keeps us watching. So, you have put the work in, you have arrived in tip-top shape, you are in the form of your life. And yet you arrive on the line, or in the call room, or on the mat, and your heart is beating faster than normal, your hands are perspiring, your vision is suddenly playing games. At this moment, there is one last quality that defines a champion. Can you deliver your best when it really matters, with the eyes of the world upon you? The pressure at the Olympic Games is unique. Mess this up and you have four more years to wait for another chance - if you get another chance. The Olympics is a test of preparation, and technique, and durability, then, but it is also - pre-eminently - a test of nerve. At the Olympic Games in Sydney in 2000, I choked. I failed to progress beyond the group stage in the men's table tennis event. The pressure was too intense, I was too worried about losing, and my fine motor skills seemed to evaporate in the metaphorical heat. It was a huge, numbing disappointment. But it taught me something else. Dealing with pressure is another aspect of performance that can be worked upon. It is not just a matter of turning up and hoping for the best, but building a set of tools and techniques that can absolutely help you to nail it when it really counts. In other words, growth mindset is not just about preparing the body, but also preparing the mind. The Olympics is the ultimate test of both.

They gathered around the fair in George Square, in darkness as a mark of respect, and the floral tributes outside the Gallery of Modern Art. They stood in silence to remember those who had been affected by the tragedy. A woman stood beside the road on Queen Street sobbing heavily, comforted by a companion. Another quietly sobbed as she looked at the floral tributes outside the Gallery of Modern Art. Many more stopped for a minute as they walked past the flowers to read the messages left with them. Some of the flowers had been left by friends and relatives who were affected by the tragedy but most were placed anonymously by members of the public. They served as a reminder for many of the shoppers and and city-centre workers who may otherwise have forgotten the tragedy's first anniversary. Several times today, passers-by questioned their companions about why the flowers had been laid. Some did not know, but when the bin lorry crash was referenced usually it was followed by a respectful silence. It was an overcast day in George Square, but the scene was brightened by a big bunch of yellow flowers. They were laid by two young colleagues of Erin McQuade, who was 18 when she died in the tragedy. The pair worked with her at Cameron House. As they laid the bunch of yellow flowers outside of the Gallery of Modern Art, one said: \"We picked these flowers because they were so bright and we thought it was a nice way to remember her on what is obviously a sad day. \"It has really affected all of her colleagues. Although we went to her funeral, we also had a night out to our local pub as a way of remembering her. \"She was genuinely the nicest person I have ever met - she was so funny.\" Another mourner, Jane McIntyre, said she did not know any of the victims, but she felt it was important to remember them and their families, especially because of the time of year. As she laid a bunch of roses, she said: \"I came last year with my daughter to lay flowers on Boxing Day, because all I could think about on Christmas Day when I was standing cutting my sprouts was that poor woman who lost her daughter and both of her parents. \"I've brought my daughter back today because I'll never, ever forget this day. It's just so sad. If that was me I don't think I'd ever be able to celebrate Christmas again.\" She laid her flowers next to those left by Glasgow's Lord Provost Sadie Docherty.

{"article": "Not one for fax machines and agents' fees, Slovenian club NK Domzale had a novel way of avoiding the madness of the January transfer window - using LinkedIn. The online networking service is best known for telling you an old colleague has a better job than yours and is mainly used in the UK by professionals such as lawyers and accountants. But after Domzale head coach Luka Elsner, 33, posted a message asking for an \"offensive right-back\" who \"must have an EU passport\", the top-flight club received 150 applications and signed Spanish defender Alvaro Brachi, 30, just before transfer deadline day. Jorge Mendes and his fellow agents must be quaking in their loafers. The advert, posted on 7 January, had got 232 views, 10 likes and eight comments by 2 February and had professional footballers sending in their highlights reels for Elsner to select the best man to fit into his \"very offensive 3-4-3 system\". NK Domzale are third in the Slovenian PrvaLiga, eight points behind leaders Olimpija while the league takes a winter break. But they lost captain Nejc Skubic to Turkish side Konyaspor at the start of the January transfer window. The club's PR officer Grega Krmavnar told BBC Sport: \"NK Domzale only has a small budget, we do not have the money to buy the biggest player. \"We needed a replacement and could not find one in Slovenia and had no other choice of players.

{"article": "Since 2014, the government has said key nursery workers must have at least a grade C in GCSE English and maths. But campaign group Save our Early Years said there was now evidence that this requirement was blocking staff career paths and deterring new starters. The Department for Education said it was working with the profession on a future staffing strategy. Figures from qualifications body Ofqual show about 12,500 students completed the Level 3 Early Years Educator course between July and September 2015, compared with 18,000 in the same period in the previous year - a fall of about 30%. The course, which takes between one and two years to obtain, enables students to obtain their first jobs in nurseries and work with children aged under five. But industry leaders warn the drop in the number of those completing it is evidence of an impending recruitment crisis, which is already damaging the quality of childcare on offer to parents. It also puts in jeopardy government plans to introduce 30 hours of free childcare to all three and four-year-olds from 2017, they say. Under current rules, staff are only allowed to look after a specified number of children: The government requires that there must always be at least one member of staff qualified to Level 3 on duty, which means these staff are essential to all nurseries. Julie Hyde, executive director at the childcare qualifications awarding body Cache, said if the government did not reverse its decision, there would be \"no nursery staff and therefore parents would have no childcare\". Liz Bayram, chief executive of the charity Professional Association for Childcare and Early Years, said nursery chains were able to move staff around to cover gaps, but sole nurseries would be hardest hit by the crisis, she added. In the association's survey of 75 Further Education college leaders, almost three quarters (72%) reported that enrolments on Level 3 courses had decreased in the latest academic year (2015-16), compared with the previous year. A separate survey of 278 private nursery owners and managers across England suggested the main reasons for nursery staff leaving their jobs were low pay and a lack of progression due mainly to the GCSE requirements. Purnima Tanuku, chief executive of the National Day Nurseries Association, which conducted the poll, said: \"The serious staffing problems caused largely by these GCSE requirements can make these businesses unsustainable and force them to turn away children.\" June O'Sullivan provides care for 4,500 children at 38 nurseries across London. As chief executive of London Early Years Foundation, she is currently grappling with her business's recruitment and retention policy to try to fill 90 vacancies (of her 650 staff) for Level 3 nursery workers. She fears that unless the government changes the requirements, the industry will end up with more unqualified staff and nurseries will see a high turnover of staff. \"People just don't understand the importance of the harmonious relationship you have to build with the children, their parents and the staff,\" she says. If parents can't be sure their children are in safe hands, in a place where they are loved, hugged and taught, this may affect their confidence in going out to work every day, she adds. Ultimately, there may be fewer nurseries, especially in London, if funds are eaten up paying agency costs. \"Nurseries are not great profit makers. There is very little margin,\" she says. Former childcare minister Liz Truss introduced the GCSE requirement in 2014 in an effort to raise the quality of care. But campaigners want the new childcare minister, Caroline Dinenage, to accept equivalent or similar qualifications, such as Functional Skills, which also tests numeracy and literacy. Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Pre-school Learning Alliance, said: \"It seems completely counterproductive to persist with a policy that is actively blocking qualified, passionate and able early years practitioners from entering the sector. \"To say that the GCSE requirement is causing a recruitment crisis is not an exaggeration,\" he added. Writing in Nursery World earlier this month, Caroline Dinenage hinted at a possible shift in government thinking, saying: \"Our Workforce Strategy is in development and I am looking at ways of getting the best individuals into the profession, while recognising that excellence can be measured by qualities other than exam results.\" A Department for Education spokeswoman said: \"We want to make sure we get the best staff into the early years sector. \"We are working with the profession to look at how we can develop people's talents and keep our most experienced staff.

{"article": "When director Naji Abu Nowar and producer Rupert Lloyd collected their shared Bafta in London this month for outstanding debut, Nowar said on stage they'd been working together since they were five.  In their mid-30s, they're about to head off to Hollywood with their first full-length film and clasping an Academy Award nomination. Nowar, half-Jordanian, says that at Grey Coates School back in 1980s Oxford they weren't actually working on a film.  \"But our love of film did become evident very quickly.  I went back to Jordan when I was 10 but whenever I was back in Oxford we'd be in and out of the cinemas.  Theeb is the culmination of a long process: we made our first short in 2009, called Death of a Boxer.\" Theeb is in Arabic with a few scenes in English.  It's the first film from Jordan to be nominated for the best foreign language film Oscar.  It's set during World War One.  The title character, aged 12, becomes disastrously involved in a British attempt to blow up a railway line constructed through the desert by the Ottoman Empire.  The story takes place in what was then the Hijaz province and the film was shot in Jordan's Wadi Rum valley. Reviews have commented on how impressive the film is on screen, which is remarkable given the budget was just under Â£500,000.  Putting together the finance was Lloyd's job. \"Initially we got seed money from the Abu Dhabi Sanad fund, which supports development.  It wasn't huge but it allowed us to live in the desert for a year.  We did workshops and we learnt a lot about the Bedouin way of life, which is a big part of the story,\" says Lloyd. \"But for production funds we turned to private investors - mainly in Jordan but also from the Gulf and a little in the UK. \"Things change once you have a cut of the film to show people.  We went looking for post-production money and secured it from the Doha Film Institute, the Sanad fund again, Visions Sud Est in Switzerland and the King Abdullah Fund for Development in Jordan.  The hardest thing was probably getting the first couple of investors.\" Despite the strong British connection, Theeb was nominated by Jordan as its submission to this year's Oscars.  Rupert calls that a huge honour.  \"And to get from the 80 nominees to the final five was an incredible moment.\" While Lloyd was putting together the patchwork of funding, Nowar was developing the script.  \"We originally had our own concept - and then a screenplay for a short film, written by Bassel Khandour. But what really made the film come alive was sitting with the Bedouin in Wadi Rum and listening to their story-telling. \"The Bedouin elders talked a lot of the catastrophe that befell their culture around World War One.  Partly it was the coming of the railway which took away their livelihood but also they were trapped in the conflict between the great powers more generally and the drawing of new national borders.  The allies, including Britain, wanted to incite an Arab revolt to undermine the Ottoman Empire. \"A lot of this still relates to politics today.  But we deliberately don't put up a card at the beginning of the film to tell people exactly where and when it's all taking place.  Because above all Theeb is an adventure film.\" Critics expressed surprise at how a film set in the Middle East a century ago so strongly evokes the feel of a Hollywood western.  Nowar says it was no accident. \"Rupert and I decided we wanted to make a Bedouin western as long ago as 2003.  It's like what Akira Kurosawa did with his samurai films: he took on the aesthetic of John Ford's cowboy films.  I love the Kurosawa's work. \"But the truth is if you have a concept you need to keep it a loose one.  Because the choices you make during filming- and just the realities of filming somewhere like the Jordanian desert - always change things along the way.\" Theeb is filled with tense and gripping sequences but there's one in particular which feels like a dramatic shoot-out in a western.  The director says he was aware of the parallel: \"But that kind of deadly ambush is also absolutely how it would work in Bedouin culture and we held true to that.\" Many are assuming that the powerful Hungarian drama about the Holocaust, Son of Saul, is bound to take the foreign language Oscar. But whether Nowar and Lloyd win or not, Theeb has boosted their careers.  Lloyd says the big moment was making it to the shortlist. \"It helps a lot in picking up more sales in new territories.  But also it's the point where suddenly people know who you are and are interested in talking to you.  The incredible Bafta win has pretty much changed our lives too.\" Yet Nowar also admits he's ready to work on a new project.  \"I love Theeb massively but whatever happens in LA it will be time to move on.  Rupert and I are working on English-language projects but we have another idea for Jordan as well.  We want to return to the story of Theeb but 10 years later. \"So we're looking to work with new partners and new companies and it's very exciting.  But the one thing I know is I would never make a film without Rupert.\" Theeb was released in the UK last year but is now out on DVD.", "question": "Few film - makers secure an Oscar nomination with their first feature .

And those connections meant that when he began to write about the brilliant maverick Edinburgh detective John Rebus, he gave him a past in Northern Ireland before he joined the Scottish police. \"It was picked up in one or two books that Rebus served time in the Parachute Regiment and served time in Northern Ireland,\" he said. \"That gave me a wee bit of a plot in one of the earlier books, but in the first couple of books I was still getting to know him, so having created that back story for him, I've got to remember 20 or 30 years on that that is his story.\" The latest of more than 20 Rebus novels has just been released and Rankin is in Belfast to introduce Even Dogs in the Wild to his many Northern Ireland fans. John Rebus is nearly 70 in the book, but, though retired, he cannot let his career fighting crime go. His life has also become increasingly intertwined with his long-time nemesis, gangster 'Big' Ger Cafferty, as he investigates a threat to Cafferty's life. \"They're like Cain and Abel - you never know if they'll become best friends or kill each other,\" he said. \"Cafferty's always had a moral code, although he's a gangster, but he now sees himself as dinosaur or an old boxer who has one fight left in him and Rebus feels the same. \"These guys are being sidelined by life, but they keep wanting to punch back.\" Readers of the series will know that the obsessive Rebus rarely takes a break, but when he does one of the few pastimes he has is listening to music, often alone late at night in his flat. And when he puts a record on, it is likely to be by a very famous Northern Ireland musician, which has led to a relationship away from the page. \"Van Morrison got to know that I was a fan of his music, so he asked me to pen the introduction to his lyrics when he was bringing a book of them out last year,\" he said. \"To promote that, he then asked if I would interview him on stage at three concerts - we did London, Dublin and then Belfast. \"I interviewed him for half-an-hour on stage in Belfast - people were crying in the audience, they'd never heard Van speak for half-an-hour before,\" he laughs. \"That was terrific, and then he invited me across for his 70th anniversary concert on Cyprus Avenue.\" \"I got to sit and watch him in the sun at the end of August, so it was a memorable occasion.\" Rankin said he also enjoys reading Northern Ireland crime writers like Adrian McKinty and Colin Bateman. Rebus may now be picking up his pension, but the character still has plenty of life. \"I can see one or two books in which I can write him almost like a private eye,\" the author said. \"He can't chase crooks or stand up to the hard men anymore, so he's got to use his wit and his guile. \"I quite enjoy that, the fact he has to live on his wits rather than by his physical presence.\"", "question": "Ian Rankin may @placeholder almost all of his novels in his home city of Edinburgh , but the crime writer has plenty of connections to Northern Ireland .", "option_0": "spend", "option_1": "set", "option_2": "finish", "option_3": "change", "option_4": "wrote", "label": 1}
{"article": "In an exclusive interview with the BBC, Islam Karimov Junior denied recent reports suggesting his mother had died, and accused the Uzbek security services of keeping her in isolation. Ms Karimova was once seen as a potential successor to her father. But she disappeared from public view in 2014 amid a damaging family feud. The name of Ms Karimova, whose ambitions ranged from business and politics to fashion and pop music, has also been linked to corruption allegations surrounding her sizeable commercial interests. Her son, who lives in London, told BBC Uzbek that Ms Karimova was being held in a \"two-to-three room annexe\" to her main property in central Tashkent. He said being held incommunicado for such a long time had affected her health. \"To be isolated for two or three years without any even basic human rights that every person deserves on this earth, I'm sure that any person will need some kind of medical attention. But mentally she is sane. The reports she was in a mental hospital are false.\" Gulnara Karimova became the international face of Uzbekistan, running a fashion label, jewellery collection and recording pop videos. She held diplomatic posts and controlled significant business interests. The secret recordings of Gulnara Karimova How do you solve a problem like Googoosha? Uzbek leader's daughter wages Twitter war But three years ago her name became embroiled in bribery and money-laundering investigations in Switzerland and Sweden which have since widened to the United States. Not long after, a deepening rift within the presidential family burst into public view. Ms Karimova's activities were soon reined in, including her outspoken social media accounts, where she began to openly attack the Uzbek security apparatus. Her son says the powerful security service, the SNB, is responsible for locking her up and for refusing access and information about what will happen next. \"I don't understand how in the 21st Century they cannot answer a simple question: Where is Gulnara?\" he says. \"House arrest, for what? For how long? Under whose supervision? These simple questions have to be answered.\" Mr Karimov Junior says he wants his mother's status to be officially recognised. \"Right now there is a rumour that she is dead. But is she? Without it being official, no one can even check these things.\" Islam Karimov Junior says he has no direct contact with his mother, but manages to stay in touch via his sister Iman, who still is in Uzbekistan. When their grandfather, the country's long serving president - whose name Islam Karimov Junior shares - died in September, neither of the siblings or their mother attended the funeral. Their absence was unusual in a country where family bonds are of great importance. But Islam Karimov Junior says his sister and mother were prevented from going and he himself could not risk the trip back home. \"I wanted to go, but I knew that if I go to the funeral I would not come back. They need all three of us there to limit our activity and our voices,\" he says. However, he hopes the country's next leader - presidential elections are being held on 4 December - might bring change. \"The current temporary president and prime minister has a unique chance to stop this madness, to end what was caused by the SNB and to legitimise himself, because everyone is watching him, everyone is thinking 'what will he do?' \"I don't think we have done anything bad towards him for him to hate my mother.\" So far there are few indications that things in Uzbekistan are going to change after the election which current acting President Shavkat Mirziyoyev is likely to win. The late Islam Karimov was accused of presiding over an authoritarian state, locking up political opponents and dissident Muslims in jails where torture is rife. Child and forced labour during the annual cotton harvest also drew strong international criticism. They are practices the young Karimov says must change for the country to modernise. His mother too had begun to speak out against rights abuses in Uzbekistan. But her critics say she only raised her voice when her own star was fading and she became a victim herself. Her son acknowledges the privileges he enjoyed growing up as part of the presidential family. But he says the last few years have been \"hell\" as well as \"a huge life lesson\" that has left him craving normality. \"I just want to see my family, I just want to see my mother, my sister.

{"article": "Places on many school sixth form or college courses depend on achieving minimum grades at GCSE - so if your marks did not meet expectations, getting good advice is crucial. Catherine Sezen of the Association of Colleges is on hand to give advice on what to do following unexpected results. YOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED My son only got three C grades and all the rest  of his GCSEs were Ds. The school he has been attending for the last five years have said that, as he only got three good GCSE's and they require at least five for sixth form, they cannot offer him a place to stay on. Where do we stand as he really wanted to stay there for sixth form? Catherine Hi Catherine I am sorry to hear that your son didn't quite achieve the grades that he wanted, but I am sure with there will be a course for him, perhaps at a different school or college. All schools and colleges have entry requirements which ‎they need to apply consistently to all applicants. If your son wants to stay at the same school it is worth asking if they have another option for him there. I would also suggest contacting your local FE college to discuss what they might be able to offer. College based vocational or technical courses have good career progression opportunities - or they might suggest an apprenticeship. If your son is worried about moving to a different school or college it would be good to find out why. All schools and colleges will have induction programmes to help students settle in and make friends. Catherine I've missed a large amount of my secondary education (almost 3 years) due to mental health issues and although it was a struggle, I managed to achieve 4 A*s, 1 A, 2 Bs, 1 C and a D. Unfortunately this D was in drama, the subject I want to focus on in college, and although the college didn't need any specific drama grade on entry (only an English grade at C or above and I achieved A*s in both literature and language) I can't help but feel this might affect my chances. Any advice? Kat Hi Kat, Well done on your GCSE results. You have done really well to achieve such good grades. The college would be best placed to advise on your drama grade though, if the entry requirements specified English grades (which you have exceeded), I don't think there will be a problem. Catherine I've just got my results, I got 3A*s and 8As. I thought I could have done better but they are OK. Do you think I can still get into medicine? Thanks, Musa Hi Musa First of all congratulations on an excellent set of results - well done! Each university will have its own entry requirements for medicine as for all subjects. I would suggest that your GCSE results would indicate that you have a very realistic opportunity to go on and be successful in your chosen field, but if you have a particular course or university in mind you could look at their entry requirements online to check what they would be looking for. Good luck with your further studies, Catherine I am disappointed with my results. I think exams are unfair because some people are unlucky when they take exams. I received an A for media studies - but because I only got a C in English language I am told I'm not allowed to take it at A-level. I was also told I could not take psychology, a totally new subject to me, because I have not got Bs in English and maths. Shouldn't people's work ethic be taken into account more when it comes to what courses they can apply for next and shouldn't coursework be a large part of the courses to make it fairer? Danny Hi Danny Well done on getting the A grade for media studies.  I would see this as an opportunity to think hard about your next steps. Why don't you contact your school and local further education college to see what options are available to you with the grades that you have achieved? BTEC courses for example include more coursework and still provide excellent opportunities for progression into work or to higher education. I am sure you will find a course which suits you and your career aspirations. Catherine My son received GCSE D grades English and maths but has already started working on an apprenticeship scheme which is full time, five days a week. I understand that if grade A-C is not achieved in English and maths then it is the law that the child must continue in education until they are 18 to try and achieve grade A*-C. Is this true in all cases such as if they are on an apprenticeship which isn't offering day release? I am delighted to hear that your son has secured an apprenticeship. If he has achieved Ds in English and maths I think that he will need to continue studying these subjects as part of his apprenticeship. I would suggest that you contact his apprenticeship provider to check whether this will mean retaking GCSE or taking Functional Skills qualifications in English and maths which are more work related. Catherine My son is normally an A student bordering on A*. He just received his GCSE results and is heartbroken. He spent many hours studying and he got just one A in maths and Bs in every other subject. His lowest percentage was 72 so why did he fail to get As across the broad? Hi Leon First of all congratulations to your son that he has done so well in passing all his GCSEs. I appreciate, however, that he may feel disappointed if he was anticipating higher grades in many of his subjects. I would suggest in the first instance that you contact his school to get their view on his grades. It may be that they will suggest a re-marking for some of his papers. However, with the grades that he has got, your son should be able to get on to the course of his choice at school or college. I wish him well in his future studies. Catherine My son did not get the required grade A in his AQA biology - he got a B. What are his options with this result? I am not sure what to do really. Lynd Hi Lynd, It sounds as if your son may well have achieved the grades he needed in his other subjects, which is great and congratulations to him.

{"article": "They are the masters of the fearful day. I have met them in the Balkans and Asia, the Middle East and Africa. Their habitat is the failed or failing state where the most cunning and violent carve out fiefdoms. There, they remain free to terrorise and extort from defenceless civilians. They thrive best in places about which the world cares little, or at least does not care enough for the most powerful nations to send their troops to enforce a long-term peace. Welcome to the world of the warlords. We may be seeing a lot more of them if President Trump keeps his promise to scale back American support for UN peacekeeping. Currently the US supplies 28.57% of the total budget for UN deployments. There are very influential figures in the Trump administration with a visceral ideological dislike of the UN. At the very least, the new UN Secretary General, Anthony Gutteres, faces an uphill fight to persuade the US to keep paying its current share of the peacekeeping budget. It was a debate much on my mind travelling in the Central African Republic (CAR). At the moment, the UN's deeply-flawed mission (Minusca) is the only thing standing between that country and genocidal anarchy. In fighting last weekend, UN attack helicopters engaged militia who were attempting to advance on the town of Bambari. This very dilapidated, dusty town on the banks of the Ouaku River has become the first big test for UN peacekeeping in the age of Gutteres. In an arc to the north, several militias are threatening to advance on Bambari. The UN has drawn red lines, pledging to fight if the militias advance. There are thousands of frightened displaced people in and around Bambari who are depending on the international community to keep its word. But matters are complicated by the presence in Bambari of warlords like Gaetan Boade, known as \"General Boade\" a leader of the Christian \"anti-Balaka\" militia. Gen Boade has never had much faith in the blue helmets of the UN. Nor does his more genial aide de camp, \"General\" Tarzan, a nickname given to him by his troops. Their stronghold is on the Christian side of Bambari, across the Ouaku River among the narrow lanes of mud houses, a place whose poverty is indistinguishable from the dismal circumstances of their Muslim enemies. Gen Boade wears a crumpled, mustard-coloured cotton suit and brown, buckled shoes. He looks more like an out-of-work musician than a feared militia leader. But he is admirably frank when I ask if he is a warlord:  \"Yes. I have 28,000 men who are ready to protect the people.\" This is a substantial exaggeration but his men are regarded as a danger to the peace should they decide to fight. The young toughs who make up his militia hid their guns during our visit. But they are well armed and their leader is openly dismissive of the UN's ability to protect Christians. \"If the Minusca were able to protect us they would stop the guy who commits exactions, who takes people as hostages, who kills in front of their eyes. Has Minusca really come to protect us?\" Bambari is filled with weapons despite the UN declaring it a non-militarised town. Nothing displays the limits of UN power quite like the swagger of Gen Boade's enemy, the Muslim leader of the Union for Peace in Central Africa (UPC) militia, \"General\" Ali Darassa, and his gun-toting army. Gen Darassa lives directly opposite the UN headquarters in Bambari. Like his enemy, he stands accused of sending his men on killing sprees in the surrounding countryside. But he has no fear of arrest by the blue helmets. Nor are they about to ask his militia to hand over the weapons they brandish during our interview. Like Gen Boade, Gen Darassa describes himself as a protector of the people. I put to him that there is another view, and that is that he is a ruthless killer. I caught a faint smirk as the question was translated. His reply was delivered in a calm monotone: \"If I were a ruthless killer, people could not live peacefully near me. \"I know that people are fleeing the other side to settle next to me.  It is because here, there is peace; there is free circulation; there is social cohesion.\" The latest fighting north of Bambari has come about because of an alliance between Muslim and Christian militias who want to dislodge Gen Darassa. The clashes illustrate the growing complexity of the crisis. Gen Darassa is an ethnic Peul, nomadic pastoralists who are being targeted by both Christian and Muslim militias on the basis of their ethnicity. Competition over resources, including gold, diamonds and cattle has created murderous momentum. The UN has drawn red lines in the past and failed to enforce its will. There is nobody more alert to weakness or disarray in the international community than the 21st Century warlord. He has studied the UN failures in Rwanda and Bosnia and other ruined places. He has seen the resurgence of violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the struggles of the UN-backed government in Somalia. He has concluded that until such time, if ever, that the UN uses force to stop him, he will continue to act like the real power in the land. That means being free to kill his enemies, and the civilians who belong to that religious or ethnic group, and to plunder and extort along the roads. The deputy chief of the UN mission is a former British diplomat, Diane Corner. She came to Bambari to tell Gen Boade and Gen Darassa what would happen if they started fighting. For weeks now, UN intelligence has been tracking the movement of convoys of armed men moving towards Bambari. The fear is of an outbreak of fighting in the town which would cause chaos for civilians. The warlords were summoned to a prefabricated office in the UN headquarters. They would not meet with Ms Corner together, so Gen Boade waited while Gen Darassa was told of the will of the international community. There were no photo opportunities. Ms Corner is a realist who understands the limits of a UN mission which must deal with complex regional politics, limited resources, uneven quality of troops, and a new occupant of the White House who believes in the mantra of \"America First\". The first thing she makes clear is that the UN had not come to negotiate with the warlords - rather to remind them that the red lines would be defended. \"I reminded them that the international community was watching, and of their responsibilities towards the civilian population whose rights must be respected,\" she said. Ms Corner is a relatively recent recruit to the UN. She seems anxious to confront the bureaucratic and political challenges that routinely dog peacekeeping missions. The fact that UN attack helicopters were deployed at the weekend proves this. Not only in the CAR, but in trouble spots across the globe there will be warlords and beleaguered civilians watching what happens next.", "question": "A change of @placeholder towards peacekeeping under US President Donald Trump could spell disaster for places like the Central African Republic , where the presence of a UN mission is trying to keep notorious warlords in check , writes the BBC 's Fergal Keane .", "option_0": "emergency", "option_1": "teeth", "option_2": "attitude", "option_3": "strategy", "option_4": "events", "label": 2}

He was impressed with how \"sad\" the 1D lads made the opening, almost \"whispering in\" the first few words. Some of the Band Aid 30 artists including Ed Sheeran, Ellie Goulding and Emeli Sande recorded solo versions of the entire track, allowing producers Paul Epworth and Midge Ure to then cherry pick who sang which line best. Bob Geldof mentioned how each full performance he'd witnessed was great on its own, making him want to release multiple takes of the song. It's an option for the CD single, which is expected at the beginning of December, although the current plan for that is to include the three previous Band Aid recordings (from 1984, 1989 and 2004) alongside some remixes of the new version. Clean Bandit had the task of scoring some new string parts for the track. That meant Neil and Grace from the band got to play violin and cello on the song, but they also sing on the big chorus at the end as well. Grace Chatto admitted she was smiling and dancing for that but as a group, all the acts had been told off for looking too serious as they sang the famous \"feed the world\" phrases (which now includes \"feel the world\" and \"heal the world\") so they all had to re-do it. As if it was ever in doubt, Bono gets to do 'his' line again (even though the lyrics have changed from \"well tonight thank god it's them instead of you\" to \"well tonight we're reaching out and touching you\").

{"article": "The speech, as delivered in town halls around England, generally went like this. \"We are the party of low taxation\". Polite applause. \"We intend to be in Europe but not run by Europe\". Polite applause with some notable abstentions. \"We are the party of English votes for English laws.\" Loud applause, roof in danger. Said leader tried this repeatedly, with the same result. But said leader also slowly concluded that, at the time, EVEL was perhaps a little too hazardous, too inclined to sow disquiet within the very United Kingdom the Tories were aiming to protect. Every Conservative leader since John Major has entered office, determined to answer the West Lothian question. Every Conservative leader since John Major has subsequently shelved the idea. Until now. David Cameron, at first, was no different. Early zeal for reform ended up, not long after he became leader, with a speech in Edinburgh in which he argued: \"Better an imperfect Union than a perfect divorce.\" To be fair, things have changed substantially. In two ways. Firstly, the constitutional arrangements of the UK are different and are about to alter still further. Secondly, the political challenge confronting the Conservatives has shifted materially with the emergence of UKIP. In days gone by, the answer generally given to the West Lothian questions by senior politicians - from Labour and other parties - was: \"Would you please stop asking such an irritating question?\" Given that this was, in the first instance, aimed at the estimable Tam Dalyell, the erstwhile MP for West Lothian, the chances of success were minimal. Tam, to his enormous and enduring credit, made a career out of asking irritating questions with admirable persistence. Like a dripping tap or a remote drain with a faint, but pungent, aroma, the West Lothian q. has hung around Scottish politics ever since Tam first drew attention to it in the 1970s. It has now been fully revived by the prime minister with a pledge to introduce English Votes for English Laws within 100 days, should he be returned to power. The change would be enforced in time for the 2016 Budget. Is David Cameron motivated by electoral reasons? You bet he is. But, then, this is an election. Politicians of every hue are seeking issues which will attract voters to their side - and cause them to shun the other lot. Mr Cameron makes two calculations. One, that an emphasis upon English voting rights may undermine the appeal of UKIP south of the Border. And, two, that spotlighting the constitution might tend to bolster the SNP in Scotland to the disadvantage of the Labour Party. For a Tory leader, what's not to like? Mr Cameron's rivals provide a range of responses. The SNP says that it will still tend to abstain at Westminster on issues which are, genuinely, of relevance to England only. However, it notes the practical difference thereby attached. This is that even a health bill covering England may have an impact upon Scotland - either because it will bring about Barnett spending consequentials or because, by deploying the private sector, it may reduce such associated cash transfers. Plus, of course, the small point that, if the SNP are to play a role in the governance of the UK, then they must be prepared to vote fairly regularly. They would not be much use as partners in the Commons if they constantly abstained. In addition, the SNP accused Mr Cameron of breaching the spirit and the terms of the Smith Commission agreement to the effect that Scottish MPs would continue to vote on UK tax matters. The Tories say MPs from Scotland still will - but at Third Reading, after English scrutiny. The Liberal Democrats, through the person of Danny Alexander, launched a particularly vituperative attack upon Mr Cameron, accusing him of breaching Smith, of seeking Tory advantage in England and of, thereby, jeopardising the UK. And Labour? They face a conundrum. They know that there is an elemental appeal in Mr Cameron's argument that EVEL involves basic fairness for the good and sensible people of England. They know this is seductive. Equally, however, they are reluctant to give ground on a principle which might make it much more difficult for a future Labour Prime Minister to legislate for England, given the division of seats. (The Tories, remember, start this election contest defending but one seat in Scotland.) They deploy two arguments in response. One, that the Tory plan risks creating two categories of MP, potentially damaging the Union. And, two, that this issue should be settled, sensibly, via mature consideration after the election - not as a partisan question during the contest. In my droll moments (yes, they do exist), I was wont to say that the more pressing West Lothian question was:  at what point in West Lothian, moving from Glasgow to Edinburgh, do the chip shops stop serving salt and vinegar and start offering salt and sauce?

{"article": "It was a sign of the hold that the charismatic German has on his Liverpool squad after eight months in charge - and how they have come to believe that every word he tells them carries weight. After the League Cup final defeat by Manchester City on penalties in February, Klopp assured his disappointed players that there would be other finals. And so it has proved, as Liverpool face Sevilla in the Europa League final in Basel on Wednesday. This is not simply a quick win for Klopp. With Champions League qualification the prize, this is the game that will shape his summer strategy and Liverpool's immediate future. BBC Radio 5 live In Short: Sevilla are favourites - Phil Neville Media playback is not supported on this device The Europa League has almost been treated as an unwanted intrusion into the calendar, Uefa's second-class citizen behind the riches and glory of the Champions League. This all changed when a Champions League place was awarded to the winners - leaving Klopp and Liverpool with the opportunity to compensate for a pedestrian eighth-place finish in the Premier League with a seat at European football's top table. Klopp wants to win silverware swiftly after losing out on the League Cup, which came on the back of three successive final defeats with previous club Borussia Dortmund - in the Champions League in 2013 and the German Cup in 2014 and 2015. \"I have too many silver medals, it's true,\" Klopp said in his pre-match news conference in Switzerland. \"But better that than no medals at all. The longer and longer it is without a win, the harder you try and the more likely it is you will win.\" It is not simply the success itself that will mean so much to Klopp and Liverpool, even though it would give them their first trophy since the 2012 League Cup. It would give huge momentum to their plans to challenge at the top of the Premier League and in Europe. Media playback is not supported on this device Liverpool's name and history alone are guaranteed to attract top players, while Klopp's record of success, his personality and his natural bond with players are other qualities they will be able to exploit. A move to Anfield is not quite such an enticing prospect without European football. For any potential signing, the extra burnish will be added by a Champions League place. Put together, an offer of Liverpool, Klopp and Champions League football would tick most of the boxes for top players in a summer when competition for targets will intensify with the arrival of Pep Guardiola at Manchester City, Antonio Conte at Chelsea and, potentially, Jose Mourinho at Manchester United. Those inside Anfield will need to be able to play every card at their disposal - and that is the difference between victory and defeat on Wednesday. Win and Liverpool are right back in the elite. Lose and a big chunk of their summer bargaining power disappears at a stroke. Media playback is not supported on this device When Klopp walked into Anfield in October, he said his first task was to turn \"doubters into believers\". It was hard to find any Liverpool fans in Basel who are not convinced by Klopp, but any remaining doubts will be blown away if he wins the Europa League so soon after his appointment. And watching the German in action in a small media room at St Jakob-Park, barely throwing a glance at the huge silver trophy to his right, it was easy to see why he is already so revered. Liverpool fans like to feel their manager represents them, feels like them, in the technical area. Klopp's all-consuming passion and animated demeanour does the job. In Basel, he was talking their language once more as he said: \"We already know about the desire of our supporters. We know how much they want to win this cup. They showed us in an impressive way at home and away travelling with us. \"It was great to see some people who didn't even travel away, Liverpool supporters who lived in Russia. We would really love to be the team that can make their dreams come true.\" Klopp does not just get his players involved - when it was needed against Borussia Dortmund in the quarter-finals and Villarreal in the last four, he got Liverpool's fans involved. He has not simply revitalised a group of players, he has revitalised the club's support. As Liverpool's players went through an hour-long open training session in front of the world's media beneath the steepling stands in Basel, Klopp circled as they took one last chance to impress before he names his line-up. They were in high spirits and Klopp was all smiles as he shook hands with the winners of a game between his squad before players such as James Milner, Jordan Henderson and Daniel Sturridge broke off to practise penalties. Klopp has been in charge of Liverpool for 51 games, winning 23, drawing 17 and losing 11. It is a mixed record but one that would look so much better with a trophy at the end of it. And the bonus has been Klopp's ability to rejuvenate players who will play key roles for Liverpool in Basel. Dejan Lovren will be the centrepiece of Liverpool's defence. The Croatia international had a shocking first season at Anfield following a £20m move from Southampton but has been commanding in this campaign, while Adam Lallana, who also struggled since arriving from St Mary's for £25m, has thrived under the German. Milner has been one of Liverpool's most important players in recent weeks, while young Belgium striker Divock Origi, criticised for his early efforts under previous manager Brendan Rodgers, now looks a potent force and a star of the future. All may have very big parts to play on Wednesday. There is nothing better than a trophy to send managers, players and fans off happy into the summer break - but failure in Basel may just concentrate Klopp's mind even further on what needs to be done in the summer. Christian Benteke says he wants to stay and fight for his place after a mixed first season following his £32.5m summer move from Aston Villa. Will he get a chance to prove his worth on Wednesday? Sturridge has the opportunity to show just how much talent he possesses and how he can make a difference on the big occasion. Klopp will need to strengthen in some areas and the win that would bring Champions League football would enable him and Liverpool to attract bigger and better. Liverpool have already secured Schalke defender Joel Matip on a free transfer for next season, while they are being heavily linked with Mainz's 22-year-old goalkeeper Loris Karius in a £5m deal designed to increase pressure on first choice Simon Mignolet.

{"article": "One of the waitresses, 24-year-old Yilin, is working a late shift. She moved to the capital from the nearby province of Hebei three years ago. Yilin tells me she is in Beijing, like the other seven million migrant workers here, to earn money and improve her life. \"As an ordinary Chinese girl, I want a comfortable home - an apartment big enough for three people,\" she says. That may be beyond her reach, as it is for many of China's migrant workers, the people who have driven this nation's impressive economic growth story. On her break, Yilin says she'd love to buy an apartment, but there's no way she can afford one on her salary. \"As everybody knows in China now, property prices are so high. I can't afford to buy it on my own.\" \"I think probably in the future I could just about afford to buy one with my future boyfriend or husband. I don't know how long it's going to take. I don't know if we'll have the money for a deposit. \"If I can find a man with more money, I won't have to struggle for too many years to save up too hard for a deposit.\" In the year to September, the average property price rose 11% in China's 70 biggest cities, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. But that's the average: in Hefei, the capital of Anhui province in eastern China, prices shot up by 47%; in Beijing, they rose by 28%. Estate agents in the capital say that in some of Beijing's most desirable developments, prices have doubled. Ma Jun, chief economist at the People's Bank of China, has used the word \"bubble\" to describe this, according to a Bloomberg translation of comments in Chinese. The property situation is of such concern, it has become the unlikely theme of a song doing the rounds on social media. The melody of TV entertainer Chen He's number is sad-sounding. But my favourite line has to be this: \"On my salary I can only afford a mortgage to buy half a toilet.\" The song is funny and really catchy, and critical of an aspect of life in China. The government is attempting to help wannabe home owners, and has introduced a load of new restrictions. In Beijing, first-time buyers must now put down at least a 30% deposit. Second-home buyers have to make a down payment of 50%. Other cities have introduced similar rules. Indeed, data suggests price growth cooled in October. But an economic adviser to the government, Xu Hongcai, has some sobering news for hopeful house hunters. \"Ordinary Chinese people need to be more realistic when they decide to buy a property to live in,\" says the deputy chief economist at the China Center for International Economic Exchanges. \"The government provides a variety of choices for low-income families. They could rent in public housing or in special flats for low-income families.\" When I ask him if owning a nice apartment in a big city is beyond the means of migrant workers, Mr Xu replies \"yes\". In a newly built apartment complex on the southern edge of Beijing, decorators are applying the finishing touches. The lobby has grand crystal chandeliers on the ceiling, the door handles are golden. One of the recent buyers, Mr Ren, says he has paid way over the odds for his apartment, and thinks he knows who is to blame. \"Prices are unreasonably high now. At this development, the average price should be 2,000 yuan ($289; Â£228) a square metre but it's actually 10 times that. \"There are about 16 or 17 buyers here who've bought as an investment, not to live here. There are just too many speculators.\" A few minutes drive away, there's an open-air canteen on a building site. It is lunchtime, so work on the half a dozen partly constructed apartment blocks has paused. A man is cooking noodles in a wok, serving them to hungry men and women sitting on blue and yellow upturned buckets. News of the government's housing intervention is making people here nervous. \"We came as migrant workers in the summer. We're farmers back home in our province,\" one of the men says. \"We mainly do decorating inside. Now it's a very hard time for construction. For the builders, the bricklayers, it's difficult. We're hoping we won't be affected as much as them. \"It pays to know lots of bosses. The more bosses you know, the better chance you have of getting a job.\" The social cost of the property frenzy may occupy the minds of most Chinese. But policymakers and economists are also worried about the financial implications. The property market is built on debt - developers have borrowed money to build; purchasers have taken on loans to buy. Some are alarmed about the size of the debt. \"We saw this in the US leading up to 2008,\" says Eric Schmidt, the chief executive of a Beijing-based multinational and a regular financial commentator on state TV. \"The government is really trying to make it easy for anybody to get loans in order to purchase new houses, new cars, whatever it may be.\" China's outstanding debt stands at 250% of GDP - two and a half times the size of its annual economic output - a level that is worrying some. \"I'm certainly concerned with where debt levels are right now. GDP numbers haven't been looking great, so new loans have been issued a lot over the past six to nine months,\" says Mr Schmidt. Loans may help prop up growth. But they could also be storing up trouble. The government is letting banks swap loans to companies for a stake in the businesses in order to ease the debt burden. Research notes from various international banks suggest 2017 could be the year China's debt-fuelled boom turns to bust. But Eric Schmidt says people should not underestimate the ability of China's Communist Party to manage the economy. \"At the same time, the government has a pretty good understanding of where they are and the risk it implies.\"", "question": "In an international restaurant in the centre of Beijing , diners are @placeholder into the self - service buffet of fish , noodles and dim sum .", "option_0": "continuing", "option_1": "tucking", "option_2": "inducted", "option_3": "emerging", "option_4": "ushered", "label": 1}

{"article": "Food Standards Scotland (FSS) has found that 400 billion calories worth of food was purchased by Scots households in 2014/15, the equivalent of just over 2,000 calories per person, per day. The report also discovered that there was 115g of sugar in the food the average Scot purchased daily last year - well above the World Health Organisation's recommended intake of 25g a day. However, its statistics should be treated with some caution. The report relates to how many calories are purchased, rather than consumed and takeaways, restaurant meals and working lunches are also excluded. Soft drinks, biscuits, confectionary, table sugar, cakes and pastries contained more than 45% of the sugar purchased by Scots last year. Although fruit topped the list of \"total sugar purchases\" in Scotland in 2014/15, many less health foods made it into Food Standards Scotland's top 10 list. The amount of regular soft drinks bought by households in Scotland dropped by 21% in 2014/15 - but sales of diet drinks remained static. A total of 173 million litres of drinks with added sugar were sold to Scots homes last year. About one billion individual servings of cakes and pastries are purchased by Scottish households annually. However the FSS has found that the amount of sugar and fats found in the products has risen steadily since 2011. The numbers of puddings and desserts bought into homes in Scotland has dropped by 7% since 2010. Despite that, the amount of fat the Scottish population receives from puddings and desserts has remained static and sugar levels have increased. FSS researchers believe their evidence suggests that products have changed their recipes to include more sugar or fat products. The volume of pies and pastries purchased in Scotland dropped by almost 17% since 2010; sausage sales fell by 8%. It has led to a drop in the amount of saturated fat and salt people in Scotland have derived from the products. Scottish households are buying slightly fewer crisps and savoury snacks than they did in 2010. The FSS believe a \"reformulation\" of the products may have led to a marked reduction in saturated fats and a small reduction in salt. People in Scotland bought 10% more oil-rich fish last year than they did in 2010.

{"article": "UKube-1 is a cubesat, packing six payloads into a space not much bigger than a shoebox. Its experiments include a study of space weather and a project to let school pupils interact with the satellite. It was commissioned by the UK Space Agency and built by Glasgow company Clyde Space. The firm has a big share of the market for cubesat components and already has orders for another two complete satellites. It says it is planning to mass-manufacture hundreds or even thousands more. Strictly speaking it is not Mission Control Maryhill but it is not far from it. The headquarters of Clyde Space is up a flight of stairs in a neat but unassuming building at Kelvin Science Park in Glasgow's West End. They will not be running the mission from here but this is where they built the first Scottish satellite. The basic cubesat concept is a cube ten by ten by ten centimetres. That's a litre into which, thanks to microelectronics, you can squeeze a lot of science. The design of UKube-1 is based on three such boxes. It is what they call a 3U cubesat. Three litres of payload. Clyde Space say this is the most advanced small satellite of its kind in the world and - they hope - the first of many. Because the economics of spaceflight are in their favour. A cubesat could cost you around $250,000. Not the sort of thing you could buy out of the housekeeping money but in the satellite business it is close to peanuts. The low weight means launch costs are also relatively low. Universities, research institutes and - increasingly - businesses are seeing them as affordable options for getting experiments and services into Earth orbit. A low orbit means some other cubesats will burn up on re-entry after just a few years. But it should not cost too much to replace - and that is where Clyde Space foresee a huge growth area. They think cubesats will become a mass market, with some companies ordering hundreds at a time. Clyde Space think they could become the first mass manufacturer of small satellites with thousands of orders on their books. But they are walking before they run. The publicity surrounding UKube-1 has helped them win orders for two more complete satellites. The business of building components and subsystems for cubesats has also continued to grow. Turnover has doubled in a year. Staff numbers have increased by 50%. This is just part of a burgeoning Scottish space industry which many Scots don't yet realise exists. A successful launch and deployment could change all that. UKube-1 was launched aboard a Russian Soyuz rocket from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. It was the Soyuz which lifted many Soviet space pioneers to orbit when Baikonur was still part of the USSR. Its 21st century incarnation continues to combine reliability with relatively low cost. UKube-1 is one of eight large and small satellites aboard for this launch, further underlining the economic arguments for both the cubesat concept and Soyuz. Baikonur occupies a hallowed place in the history of spaceflight. Sputnik 1, Earth's first artificial satellite, lifted off from there. So did Yuri Gagarin, the first human in space. The launch of Scotland's first satellite is admittedly a smaller milestone.

The government hopes to make A-levels and GCSEs in England more rigorous. It wants pupils to achieve the levels met in high-performing countries such as Singapore, Korea and Hong Kong. In an attempt to achieve this, ministers have ordered the biggest shake-up of the exams system in three decades. This includes phasing in new, tougher GCSEs and A-levels with new content and examinations at the end. The biggest change introduced in the autumn term will be at AS-level. Currently taught in the first year of sixth form, the qualification will no longer count towards the final A-level result in many, but initially not all, subjects. NAHT general secretary Russell Hobby said: \"We face an extended period of volatility. \"The cause of this volatility is the sheer scale and speed of changes to the examination system - changes to both the scoring of the exams themselves, and to the way these scores are used to judge the performance of schools.\" He said that on top of this, a new way of measuring both secondary and primary school performance was being introduced. \"Not all of these changes are bad,\" Mr Hobby said. \"The concern is that the scale and pace of them will make it very hard indeed to know what will happen and how the changes will interact.\" Association of School and College Leaders general secretary Brian Lightman said: \"School and college leaders are deeply unhappy about the way in which a large number of changes to exams have been introduced in a short space of time in a piecemeal manner. \"This has resulted in them having to manage an extremely difficult situation, with changes to many different qualifications happening at different times. \"This process has also put teachers under a great deal of unnecessary pressure, and the confusing nature of the changes has caused students and their parents anxiety. \"These problems could have been avoided if changes had been introduced in a more manageable and coordinated way.\" At 1,300-pupil comprehensive Hampstead High School, in north London, assistant head Adam Hedley said: \"The entire school is going to be affected in some way by the first of the exam reforms. \"The problem has been making sure we are able to cover all the stuff we need to cover in Years 7, 8 and 9 to prepare them to start the new GCSE curriculum.\" Head of sixth form at the school, Zoe Fisher, says she is trying to decide whether to continue to run a stand-alone AS-level course for pupils who only want to study for one year. If she does, she will also have to run a separate new A-level course for those who want to complete two years of study. At GCSE, English and maths will become more challenging. Topics such as calculus, differentiation and kinematics, previously taught to 17-year-olds will now be introduced to 15-year-olds. Teachers have dubbed the new course \"big maths\" because there is so much more content.  Some schools have estimated they will need an extra hour each week to teach it. The government says it is making the changes to raise standards - so England's schools can compete with some of the top ranking education systems in the world like those in Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong. Other GCSE subject changes will be phased in over the next few years. Last week at a speech in Coventry, exams regulator, Ofqual, warned the system could not tolerate any further reform under a future government until these changes have been completed and allowed to settle. A Department for Education spokesperson said: \"As part of our plan for education we have made important reforms to our exam system to ensure young people leave school ready to succeed in life in modern Britain. \"Our crucial reforms are ensuring pupils take qualifications that are on a par with the best in the world. We recognise that these vital reforms have led to changes in the system but they can be implemented, which is a testament to the dedication of our schools and teachers. \"We are replacing the system which rewarded schools to push pupils to scrape a C and moving to a new system which encourages high-achievers and recognises schools for the progress made by all pupils.\"", "question": "Changes to the exam system , which come into force in six months , @placeholder causing significant problems for schools , head teachers are warning .", "option_0": "causing", "option_1": "risk", "option_2": "show", "option_3": "paving", "option_4": "leaving", "label": 1}

Edexcel managing director Ziggy Liaquat said: \"Technology has the potential to transform education by making its delivery more personalised, efficient and effective and more transparent and secure.\" AQA chief executive Andrew Hall welcomed Ms Nisbet's comments and said it was \"really important\" that students be \"assessed in the same way that they learn and using the technologies that are commonplace in the world outside the classroom\". \"The real prize here is to have assessment, online, on-demand, when the student is ready,\" he said, suggesting a future where students did not all take their exams at the same time. However, a spokesman for OCR said the board's focus \"was not to make existing paper-and-pen tests electronic but to explore ways that computers can add real value to assessment\". John Hand, BBC News Last year, I took an A-level - partly out of journalistic curiosity about how much exams have changed in the 20 years since I last did so. I found that one thing had remained resolutely the same. The ultimate test of knowledge in any subject comes down to a two-and-a-half hour writing marathon on good old-fashioned pen and paper - and your arm aches for hours afterwards. In common with many teenage students, I rarely used pen and paper during my course. Assignments were completed on computer - and I even got into the habit of entering key grammar reminders into my mobile. But with the exam approaching, I worried about how my handwritten scrawl - badly affected by 20 years of using journalistic shorthand - would be deciphered by an examiner. When the results eventually came out, I performed noticeably better in the oral and listening exams than in the papers which demanded long bursts of wielding a pen. Is taking an A-level easier 20 years on? Send your comments The board's chief executive, Mark Dawe, said that moving to a computer-based system posed \"real challenges\" in terms of providing fair, secure computer access in schools. Sion Humphreys, a policy adviser for the NAHT headteachers' union, echoed his concerns, adding that resources were a \"thorny\" issue at a time of cuts to technology investment in schools. \"You might have a large comprehensive where there are 240 young people in a year group - it's just not conceivable to think of 240 computers being available at the same time, all in working order, at the same time under, the same conditions,\" he said. Mr Humphreys also disagreed that pen and paper could make exams become \"invalid\". \"Yes, they are using technology increasingly in schools as a medium of learning, but they're still also using pen and paper as well and there's a place for that,\" he said. Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have their own exam regulators. GCSEs and A-levels offered by the three exam boards can be taken all over the UK, although most Scottish students sit Scottish highers instead.", "question": "Computerised exams should replace pen and paper tests for a @placeholder used to digital learning , the head of England 's exams watchdog has said .", "option_0": "generation", "option_1": "method", "option_2": "lifetime", "option_3": "product", "option_4": "gain", "label": 0}
{"article": "Sean O'Halloran, 30, from Northland Road in Derry is accused of raping a woman in May 2014. The defendant who is a journalist with BBC Radio Foyle faces two additional charges of sexual assault on the same date. Mr O'Halloran, who denies all the charges, is on trial at Londonderry Crown Court. The court was played a recorded interview from 21 May 2014, in which the woman, who cannot be named, told a detective that she had been having a normal Saturday night and had been to a bar with friends before she and her boyfriend invited a number of people, including Mr O'Halloran, back to their house. She said she had been watching a film but went to bed because she was tired and that her boyfriend and two male friends were left downstairs. She told the detective she got into bed fully clothed and that a short time later she had felt someone getting into bed beside her and putting an arm around her. The woman told the detective she had assumed it was her boyfriend but that a minute later she felt this person pulling off her trousers and underwear. When she turned around she said she could see who it was. She described him as being completely naked, that he ripped her top off and that he then sexually assaulted and raped her. The woman went on to say that she tried to shove Mr O'Halloran off her and that she started screaming and asking him 'what he was doing?' She said he initially said nothing before asking her: \"What are you doing?\", \"what are you talking about?\" The woman said she ran downstairs and told her boyfriend what had happened before calling the police. She further told the detective that she had known Mr O'Halloran for a couple of years and had disliked him because he had made previous advances towards her, which she had resisted. She said on one occasion he had grabbed her legs and tried to kiss her. Under cross-examination by a defence lawyer, the woman denied that sexual contact had been consensual or that she had made her claims up for money.

{"article": "But the overall national picture for GCSE grades is very similar to last year. The proportion getting A* to C grades has nudged up from 68.8% to 69%. That represents an improvement for more than 10,000 exam entries. But the overall message - and the even smaller decline in the proportion of top A* and A grades - is that there is \"stability\". This isn't an accident. The annual exam results are not like going outside and measuring the temperature as a natural phenomenon which might fluctuate. It's more like setting the central heating to an agreed level and then holding up a thermometer to see if the temperature is where it should be. Well, perhaps that's not a complete analogy, but the national exam statistics, with their neat similarity to last year, are a work of design rather than nature. The huge annual challenge for the exam system is to balance a number of competing demands. There has to be room for some slight ups and downs, but there mustn't be grade inflation, standards have to be maintained over time and - at the very heart of the process - it has to be a fair reward for the hard work of individual pupils. Add to this complex equation the need to adjust grades between different exam boards. Head teachers' leader Brian Lightman has complained that below the smooth surface of the national statistics, there can be doubts about the reliability of individual results. He has warned of \"volatility\", with heads unable to explain sudden dips and spikes, problems that remain unnoticed from a national perspective. \"It is devastating for a student who has been on course for a certain grade to miss what they were expected to achieve and it is mystifying to their teachers,\" said Mr Lightman. The lingering question is if one year's results are reverse engineered to be very similar to the year before, does this mean distorting some of the results to make sure that they fit? Are there winners and losers in some subjects and at some grades? Ofqual has always argued that fairness for individual students is not compromised by the demands of the wider results system. But it's a massively complicated challenge for exam boards and regulator - made even more difficult by the conflicting legacies of previous grading systems. Once there was a system of fixed quotas which prevented any rise in grades and then a system which allowed grades to rise every single year. Now there is a system which holds out the possibility of change, but which manages to keep things the same. Another factor that gets overlooked in the headlines, is that the results can be changed by who is taking the exam. This year's nudge upwards in the pass rate has come alongside an older cohort. There are fewer 14 and 15 year olds taking the GCSEs early, because the league tables now only recognise the first attempt. And another change in government policy means that pupils who missed out on GCSE maths and English last year are having to re-sit the exam this year. This means that more than 300,000 exam entries were from 17 year olds. But if the changes at the overall level are measured in fractions of a percentage point, there are some very striking differences between England, Northern Ireland and Wales. Northern Ireland's pupils are stretching their lead over everyone else, jumping by 0.7% to 78.7%. It raises the question how such results can be achieved when only 66% make the grade in Wales. Not only is the Northern Ireland figure far ahead of England, it is ahead of the highest-achieving part of England, which was London with 72%. England's education system has been in a state of almost constant reform since the late 1980s, but the latest results show it is Northern Ireland that is stretching further ahead. When these regional differences are overlaid with the gender gap, it means that young women in Northern Ireland are doing much better than anyone else. The scores from the GCSE top grades show the gap. Among entries from female pupils in Northern Ireland, 11.4% achieve A* grades. Among male pupils in Wales, the figure is 4.5%. In England, 5.2% of entries from male pupils and 7.9% of female achieve these highest A* grades. This sets a pattern for A-levels and university entry, with Northern Irish women the most likely in the UK to get university places. Whether or not it is going to be consolation for England's school leaders, such comparisons are soon going to be impossible. Because in a couple of years England's GCSEs will begin to be graded from 9 to 1 rather than A to G, ending a common system with Wales and Northern Ireland. Another curious aside is that many of the pupils taking GCSEs this year in England did not take their Sats tests five years ago, because of a primary school teachers' boycott. What difference did it make in the long term? It would take another exam to answer that one.", "question": "The results have been @placeholder for more than five million GCSE entries - which will be five million different stories of exam dreams , dramas and disasters .", "option_0": "sacked", "option_1": "published", "option_2": "detained", "option_3": "recorded", "option_4": "cited", "label": 1}
{"article": "The Federation Against Copyright Theft (Fact) also says it is coming up with new ways to try to tackle piracy. It says it is now targeting people who host links which allow other internet users to access illegal copyrighted content online. Fact is warning users of similar sites that they should \"watch out\" too. Britain's television and film industries say copyright theft costs them hundreds of millions of pounds a year. The director general of Fact, Kieron Sharp, says: \"We're not after the ones who download a few films or watch something from a streaming website, we're after the people behind that.\" One tactic Fact says is working well is \"a domain sign over\". Investigators go to the home of the person hosting a website which is making protected content available to everyone for free. The host is then given a cease and desist order, asking them to take down the website and to hand over the domain rights to Fact. That means when a user goes to that site they are redirected to other places which show material legally. If a website host refuses to hand over the rights, Fact says it has other options to explore and will take action. Investigators say they will take the evidence they have gathered to the police to start criminal proceedings. Fact says Tom's website, featured in the video above, provided access to a certain type of file, called NZBs. It claims those files are used to find and download data easily from the internet. Once all the bits of data are downloaded they can then be used to play a film, TV show or piece of music. The investigators have told Tom the studios they work for do not release their content using the NZB file format. Tom says that he doesn't feel he has done anything wrong. Fact says it has successfully taken action against other websites who've used NZBs for copyright infringement. In 2011, piracy cost the television and film industry in the UK Â£511 million, according to Fact. Kieron Sharp says a lot of \"criminal money\" is being made. \"It's harming the industry which produces those films and TV programmes in the first place,\" he adds.

{"article": "Most Scottish universities have maintained or improved their standing in the league table. Overall Edinburgh University came out in 4th place while Glasgow University was 13th. More than 85% of university research in Scotland was judged to have an outstanding or very significant impact in wider society and economy. This figure was higher than the UK average. The analysis, produced by Research Fortnight, was based on the results of the 2014 Research Excellence Framework (REF 2014). This was a large-scale exercise which reviewed the quality of research in different subjects at universities across the UK. Panels of experts scored the work of more than 52,000 academics from 154 UK universities. Both Edinburgh and Glasgow Universities moved up one place in the table compared to the last one in 2008. St Andrews, Strathclyde, Aberdeen, Dundee, Heriot-Watt and Stirling also made the top 50. Strathclyde's physics department was named as the best in the UK - ahead of Oxford, Cambridge and Imperial College. Aberdeen and Dundee both slipped back slightly in the overall rankings, while the others moved up. Broadly speaking, the data suggested Scottish universities have maintained or even improved their research rankings since tuition fees for Scottish students were abolished. International rankings also suggest the broad position of Scottish universities is being maintained. Every one of Scotland's 18 higher education institutions undertakes research judged to be of \"world-leading\" quality while Scotland performs more highly than the UK average when assessed on the impact of its research. For the first time, REF 2014 also assessed the impact the research has had on the economy, society, public policy, culture and the quality of life. Laurence Howells, chief executive of the Scottish Funding Council, said: \"Today we have had confirmation that our universities' research is world-leading and impacts on almost every aspect of daily life, from the way we treat patients in hospital, to the way we communicate with smartphones. \"By making the most of our investments in research, Scotland's universities are rightly on the podium with the best in the world. It is particularly satisfying that Scotland's pioneering approach to collaboration through research pooling has helped to bring this success in the REF.\" Each of the University of Edinburgh's three colleges had at least one research area ranked top in the UK. Edinburgh research in Sociology, in Earth Systems and Environmental Sciences and in Computer Science and Informatics was rated the best in the UK, based on breadth and quality of research. The principal, Prof Sir Timothy O'Shea, said: \"Research at the University of Edinburgh is constantly expanding the depth of human knowledge and making an impact on the wider world - whether it be improving the effectiveness of youth justice policy and practice, or shaping the technologies used to manage the world's data. \"Our outstanding researchers enable us to forge links with charities, businesses, policy makers and other universities, so that together we can tackle long-standing challenges at home and overseas.\" The University of Glasgow said its achievements included pioneering research in medicine with new drugs and treatments; software revolutionising the design of electric motors; new ways of controlling animal diseases including TB in cattle and rabies; a positive impact on knife crime policy; and assisting the transformation of Stirling Castle into one of the UK's leading heritage sites. Principal and vice-chancellor Prof Anton Muscatelli said: \"It is particularly pleasing that, in line with the aspirations of the university set out in the university's 2020 Global Vision, 31% of our output was judged to be of 'world-leading' quality.  This success lies at the very heart of our contribution to the UK's economy and, in particular, Scotland's economy.\" The report was welcomed by Education Secretary Angela Constance, who said Scotland was \"globally recognised for pioneering research\", with four universities in the world's top 200. This was more per head of population than any other country except Switzerland, she said. Ms Constance added: \"The 2014 Research Excellence Framework has now shown that all of our institutions are producing world-class research in a variety of areas. \"Research is also key to our economic growth and prosperity. Figures published earlier this year showed that our Â£124m investment in eight innovation centres has the potential to generate up to Â£1.5bn and around 5,000 jobs for the economy, through sectors such as energy, aquaculture and construction.\" However, the University and College Union warned that world-leading research was too often being conducted by people on zero-hours contracts. It also warned institutions against using any perceived low scores as an excuse to consider reducing staff numbers. The union added that lots of research not included or rated highly in the REF still made a hugely important contribution. UCU Scotland official Mary Senior said: \"Our universities must be free to continue pushing the boundaries in their cutting-edge work. We must also recognise that a lot of research not included or rated highly in the REF is still incredibly important. \"Too often our world-leading research is being conducted by people with little or no job security. Universities must avoid any knee-jerk reactions to the results or use perceived low scores to try and make unnecessary cuts. \"We are not alone in criticising what we see as a flawed process when it comes to the REF and have outlined the need for a fundamental overhaul of the research system.

{"article": "This happened in the 1960s in Cessnock, a former mining town in the New South Wales Hunter Valley, but only now has this and other decades-old stories of sexual violence and degradation been heard, catalogued and, crucially for many victims, believed. The Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse is an unprecedented investigation into an epidemic of depravity across Australia. The far-reaching inquiry began in 2013 and has heard from thousands of survivors of paedophiles who worked, or volunteered, in sporting clubs, schools, churches, charities, childcare centres and the military. It has the power to look at any private, public or non-government body that is, or was, involved with children. The Commission's task is to make recommendations on how to improve laws, policies and practices to protect the young. To date, it has held more than 6,000 private sessions, along with several high-profile public hearings. Paul Gray told investigators that between the ages of 10 and 14, he was sexually assaulted by Father Peter Rushton in Cessnock every one or two weeks. Sometimes, his attacker had an accomplice. \"I was chased by two men to the edge of the cliff and I hid in the bushes. \"After a while they dragged me from the bushes and I was raped by the two men, and while I was being raped I could hear another boy screaming,\" said Mr Gray, fighting back tears as he recounted memories that have burned inside him for half a century. Too ill to travel from the Vatican to Sydney to give evidence, Australia's most prominent churchman, Cardinal George Pell, was questioned via video link by the Royal Commission over what he knew about alleged abuse and cover-ups within the Catholic Church. For four days earlier this year, the senior Vatican official was quizzed, denying any personal wrongdoing but conceding the organisation had made grave errors. \"I am not here to defend the indefensible,\" said Cardinal Pell. \"The Church has made enormous mistakes, is working to remedy those, but the Church has in many places - certainly in Australia - mucked things up.\" When he was 13, John Ellis, a former altar boy, was molested by an Australian monk who was also implicated in a suspected paedophile ring at a former Catholic boarding school in the Scottish Highlands. Now a solicitor, Mr Ellis works with other victims, and we meet at a public hearing held by the commission on the 17th floor of Governor Macquarie Tower that stands over central Sydney. Presiding over the session is the chief royal commissioner, Justice Peter McClellan, a judge of appeal in New South Wales. He is one of six commissioners; two women and four men, and they include a former Queensland police chief, a consultant child psychiatrist and a retired federal politician. They have fanned out across Australia to document a nation's shame. \"The most important thing for people in being invited to give their own stories and having their stories valued is that somebody cares,\" Mr Ellis told the BBC news website. \"For many, many years people have been silenced, people have been fearful of what reaction they will get if they were to tell their truth. The overwhelming emotion people have when they have had that opportunity is empowerment.\" When it hands down its final report at the end of 2017, this painstaking inquiry will have lasted for almost five years.  Already, more than 1,700 cases have been referred to the authorities, including the police. More prosecutions will almost certainly follow, but many victims will never savour justice. Dr Wayne Chamley, from Broken Rites, a group that gives a voice to the abused, said decades of brutality had left a terrible legacy. \"When you look at the rate of suicide for men who had these experiences and compared it with age-matched data from the coroners' courts, their risk factor is 20 to 40 times higher for suicide,\" he explained to the BBC. \"There are townships where there have been waves of suicide with hundreds of men. [In] Ballarat [in Victoria state], at least 50 or 60 suicides across just three classes in the primary school - just three classes of boys who became men. Bang. Devastating.\" Gerard McDonald, 52, is a survivor of abuse, and one of thousands of people who have told their stories to the commission. His attacker, a Catholic priest, has spent 14 years in prison for attacking 35 boys. \"After every other altar boy practice in 1975, before dropping me home Father (Vincent) Ryan would sexually abuse me. All I could do was think about running to my mate's place and getting the biggest two knives he had and killing him,\" he said. While this harrowing process is undoubtedly cathartic for Australia - and it's inevitable that legislation and procedures will eventually change to make children safer - campaigners insist many youngsters today still remain at risk from predators in institutions, while paedophiles stalking the internet continue to groom the vulnerable.", "question": "In Australia , a boy of 10 is raped by an Anglican clergyman , who cuts his victim with a small knife and smears blood over his back in a @placeholder ritual to symbolise the suffering of Christ .", "option_0": "bid", "option_1": "gripping", "option_2": "healing", "option_3": "twisted", "option_4": "phone", "label": 3}
{"article": "Fingers are increasingly pointing to a piece of Ukrainian tax-filing software, MEDoc, as the source of the infection, although the company denies it. Malware generally infiltrates networks via email attachments that users click on in error. Microsoft described the method as \"a recent dangerous trend\". The cyber-attack has caused disruption around the world and infected companies in 64 countries, including banks in Ukraine, Russian oil giant Rosneft, British advertising company WPP and US law firm DLA Piper. Shipping giant Maersk said it was unable to process new orders and was expecting delays to consignments, while one of Europe's largest port operators in Rotterdam said that it had to use manual processes, and Dutch global parcel service TNT said it was operating with restrictions. A Cadbury's factory on the island state of Tasmania ground to a halt when computer systems went down, according to Australian Manufacturing and Workers Union state secretary John Short. Ukraine was hit hardest, suggesting the attack might be politically motivated. According to anti-virus vendor ESET, 80% of all infections were in Ukraine, with Germany second hardest hit with about 9%. A growing number of security experts, including the British malware expert Marcus Hutchins - credited with ending the WannaCry ransomware outbreak - claim to have logs that reveal MEDoc as the source. In email correspondence with the BBC, Mr Hutchins said: \"It looks like the software's automatic update system was compromised and used to download and run malware rather than updates for the software.\" It was not yet clear how it had been compromised, he added. MEDoc has denied the claims, in a Facebook post - but in a blog post analysing how the infection had taken hold on Windows machines, Microsoft also points the finger at the accounting software. \"Active infections of the ransomware initially started from the legitimate MEDoc update process,\" it writes. Alan Woodward, a computer scientist from the University of Surrey, said: The ironic thing about this situation (if it proves to be the case) is that we always advise users to keep their software up to date, ideally using automated updates. \"However, it assumes hackers can't take over the update process and misuse it. \"This process is normally a very tightly controlled process, so this is unusual. \"I can imagine many vendors are now triple-checking to make sure they don't end up being an attack vector.\" He said that it showed \"hackers will probe every possible channel\" to find a route into systems. \"As users there isn't a lot we can do as we are in the hands of the software vendors.\" As to how the infection spread beyond Ukraine, he added: \"I wouldn't mind betting that a lot of these multinationals such as Maersk and Merck had this software installed.\" Mikko Hypponen, a security expert at F-Secure, has studied the recruitment pages of many of the companies affected and found that some did indeed use the MeDoc software. \"If you do business in Ukraine, the software appears to be de facto,\" he said. There were other anomalies in the attack that pointed to it having been targeted, said Prof Woodward. \"The software was sophisticated, but the attackers only provided one single email address and that was closed down very quickly so it is difficult not to conclude that this wasn't about money but targeted at Ukraine or those doing business with it,\" he said. A Kremlin spokesman said that the malware attack had caused no serious damage in Russia. \"Protection systems have been quite effective both at state and corporate levels,\" said presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov. He added that the origin of the attack remained unclear. Most security experts agree that the virus, thought to be a new variant of the Petya ransomware, was spread using a Windows vulnerability known as Eternal Blue, discovered by the National Security Agency and leaked online. Mr Hypponen told the BBC that it was \"completely clear\" that hackers in both WannaCry and Petya outbreaks had used the NSA exploit. The fact that it had now been leaked and was being used by criminal or political hackers was \"a nightmare scenario\" for the intelligence agency, he said. \"It chose to use the exploit, not tell Microsoft about it and weaponise it, and now it has been leaked, made public and used in an attack,\" he said. The NSA has not publicly acknowledged that its tools have been used in any hacking attacks, but it has not denied it either. Typically ransomware spreads via email, with the aim of fooling recipients into clicking on malware-laden files that cause a PC's data to become scrambled before making a blackmail demand. But other ransomware, including Wannacry, has also spread via \"worms\" - self-replicating programs that spread from computer to computer hunting for vulnerabilities they can exploit. The current attack is thought to have worm-like properties. Several experts believe that one way it breaches companies' cyber-defences is by hijacking an automatic software updating tool used to upgrade an tax accountancy program. Once it has breached an organisation, it uses a variety of means to spread internally to other computers on the same network. One of these is via the so-called EternalBlue hack - an exploit thought to have been developed by US cyberspies, which takes advantage of a weakness in a protocol used to let computers and other equipment talk to each other, known as the Server Message Block (SMB). Another is to steal IT staffs' credentials and then make use of two administrative tools: PsExec, a program that allows software installations and other tasks to be carried out remotely; and WMIC (Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line) a program that allows PCs to be controlled by typing in commands rather than via a graphical-interface. Once a PC is infected, the malware targets a part of its operating system called the Master Table File (MFT). It is essential for the system to know where to find files on the computer. The advantage of doing this rather than trying to encrypt everything on the PC is the task can be achieved much more quickly. Then between 10 to 60 minutes later, the malware forces a reboot of the computer, which then informs the user it is locked and requires a payment for them to get a decryption key.", "question": "A global cyber - attack that affected companies around the world may have started via @placeholder updates on a piece of accountancy software .", "option_0": "corrupted", "option_1": "increasing", "option_2": "fuel", "option_3": "running", "option_4": "spurred", "label": 0}

In the latest incident which took place last Friday, the man, surnamed Chen, was touring the wildlife park with a friend in a car.

{"article": "The court also heard school caretaker Sean McKenna had to drink from the animal's dish. He was slammed into concrete posts and made to go barefoot after being taken from his Newry home in August 1971, it was claimed. Lawyers for his daughter argued the interrogation techniques \"ruined\" him. It was claimed the experiences worsened a heart condition that led to his death four years later at the age of 45. Mary McKenna is taking legal action along with other surviving members of the so-called Hooded Men in a bid to secure an independent and human rights-compliant investigation into their treatment. Proceedings have been issued against the chief constable, secretary of state and the Department of Justice over alleged failures to properly probe and order a full inquiry. Five techniques were said to have been used against the men while they were held without trial: Counsel for the group claim they were tortured using methods sanctioned by the British state. Former prime minister Edward Heath was allegedly involved in the decision making process, while Stormont's prime minister at the time, Brian Faulkner, was said to have been personally briefed on the deployment of the methods. Ms McKenna's legal representatives argued that her case also raises a potential breach of Article 2 right to life under European law. Ms McKenna stressed that no one should have been subjected to the alleged torture, but described her father as particularly vulnerable due to his heart condition. His internment ended in May 1972, when he was released on medical grounds to enter a psychiatric hospital. But the impact of being subjected to the five techniques caused his psychiatric breakdown, according to his daughter. \"My father had been a great man before he had been interned, but that man never returned to us,\" she stated. \"He had been ruined by his experiences.\" The court heard that a doctor who examined Mr McKenna two and a half years after he was subjected to the interrogation techniques described him as tense, anxious and sobbing. He complained of serious psychiatric symptoms, including contemplation of suicide. In a further report following a second examination in June 1975, the medical expert concluded that Mr McKenna's health had gone downhill. He was by then suffering from severe chest pains and hypertension. With Mr McKenna assessed as already having angina before his internment, the doctor said it would be hard to show it was wise to proceed with the techniques, or that the treatment did not worsen his condition. His other psychiatric symptoms were also linked to the deep interrogation procedures. Mr McKenna died of a fatal heart attack in June 1975. The medical evidence, Ms McKenna's barrister submitted, backs allegations that the alleged torture was responsible for death as well as psychiatric injuries. However the barrister for the government and chief constable, countered that the 1998 Human Rights Act has no retrospective powers. \"The obstacle that poses for the applicants is profound,\" he told Mr Justice Maguire. Allegedly misleading medical evidence and the disclosure of a memo from Home Secretary Merlyn Rees in 1977 giving his view that the decision to deploy torture methods was taken at ministerial level, is not enough get over that hurdle, the barrister argued. The court also heard civil actions brought against the state by all 14 men were settled in the 1970s, with compensation paid out.

{"article": "Two years ago, American film maker Jeremy Saulnier took his revenge film Blue Ruin to Cannes to screen as part of the Directors' Fortnight - a strand of the film festival which has screened early works from Martin Scorsese and Ken Loach to more recent films by the likes of Clio Bernard. His new film Green Room casts British acting royalty Patrick Stewart as the leader of a gang of white supremacists in a Portland backwater bar. They lay siege to a dressing room where a young band are cowering, having witnessed the aftermath of a brutal murder. And it's all set to a thrashing punk soundtrack. \"I grew up in the punk rock hardcore scene in Washington DC and had always been attracted to the aesthetic of that world,\" he explains. \"It's also very kinetic and physical and I loved that world. My high school years were spent with my friends making movies and playing in punk rock bands so the idea's been gestating for quite some time.\" The film also features Star Trek actor Anton Yelchin, as the band's bass player, with Arrested Development's Alia Shawkat as the guitarist. British actor Joe Cole, seen recently in Peaky Blinders, and Callum Turner play the other band members. British actress Imogen Poots is also stuck in the room with them, sporting plenty of attitude and a rather marvellous Chelsea fringe haircut [a punk style long at the front and short or shaved at the back]. The decision to cast a renowned stage actor against type as a backwater racist is the one of which Saulnier is most proud. \"We were about two weeks out of shooting and we still didn't have Darcy [Stewart's character] and I thought the film would implode,\" he admits. \"But Patrick swooped in. He got the script, he saw Blue Ruin and he was up for an adventure.\" The British actor arrived on set pre-prepared, having worked on a detailed back story with the director. \"You hear horror stories of big name actors being a nightmare and not knowing their lines but he came in, he knew everything he had to do and discussed everything,\" he says. Saulnier also cast his best friend Macon Blair, who starred in Blue Ruin, as another member of the skinhead gang. \"He got his hair cut short and bought fake tattoos from the internet and auditioned for the role,\" says Saulnier. \"I thought, 'not only is he going to get this role, he's the only person who can do it'.\" Another key character is the music, which plays a major role in the film. \"We have Slayer, we have Bad Brains, we have CCR [Creedence Clearwater Revival]. All of these crazy awesome bands. \"But also in the background of some of the scenes, and in one of the live performances, are [songs] from my high school bands. \"Hearing these songs that I used to hear in 1994 in Virginia being played live by Anton and Alia was a dream come true. The film is incredibly violent with various characters dispatched with shotguns, machetes and even a vicious dog. But the director insists \"ideally there is an emotional impact to everything. The visceral blowback of seeing these acts on screen is not easy to digest - it's never supposed to rest easy.\" The press screening at Cannes over the weekend was punctuated with gasps and squeals, which delighted Saulnier. \"This is a straight up genre film, it's for my 19-year-old self and the kids I grew up with. It's a movie for fans, if you're a horror nerd. \"But I also wanted to make sure that the violence is not celebrated. It's grounded and brutal and it has to serve the intensity of the story. If it's just violence for violence's sake, you lose the value of it.\" For all the horror, Green Room is not without lighter moments of comedy, which often serve as a release valve for some of the more intense moments. A neat running gag involves the band all choosing a band which they would take with them on to a desert island. They all go for the most obscure, credible bands until they face genuine danger and the truth comes spilling out. Without ruining the joke too much, it seems the hardest punks have a weakness for pop music. And it has a great payoff in the film's closing scenes. \"I always find humour in dark places, it also seems natural. I really let it evolve and I find a little irony here or a moment for a character. I like the fact when the characters are not experts and [there is] lots of confusion and miscommunication, that is a good environment for dark comedy.\" So, what is Saulnier's one desert island band? \"Definitely (Black) Sabbath,\" he says.

{"article": "The frontrunner: La La Land Surely, with a record-equalling 14 nominations, this will waltz off with the top award. It's classic yet contemporary. It feels unlike any other modern film, yet feels so right. And it's about the agony and ecstasy of \"making it\" in Hollywood. What could be more Oscar-friendly? The challenger: Moonlight A beautifully-crafted film and a beautifully-told story, Moonlight gives screen time to the type of central character that Hollywood doesn't normally dwell on, or does so only as a stereotype - a poor, young, gay, black, marginalised man. The outsider: Hidden Figures This real-life story of three black, female mathematicians in a white, male world at Nasa in the 1960s has exceeded expectations at the US box office, and is the highest-grossing of the nine best picture nominees. The frontrunner: Emma Stone (La La Land) If La La Land is to sweep the board, then it will sweep Emma Stone along with it. She's also at the age, and the stage of her career, at which the Academy likes to admit female stars to its A list. The challenger: Isabelle Huppert (Elle) The French actress won a Golden Globe for her role in rape revenge thriller Elle, and there's a strong contingent that thinks the Oscars should give her the credit she deserves for her 40-year career. The outsider: Natalie Portman (Jackie) At one stage, Portman and Stone were neck-and-neck. The Academy loves stars who transform themselves into real-life legends, as Portman has with former US first lady Jackie Kennedy. But Jackie has underperformed at the box office and elsewhere in the Oscar nominations. The frontrunner: Denzel Washington (Fences) Denzel is probably the marginal favourite in this race. If he wins, he will become only the fourth man to have won three acting Oscars, and will be the oldest best actor winner for 25 years. Or maybe the frontrunner is: Casey Affleck (Manchester by the Sea) It's a close call, and Casey is still in very much contention for his depiction of pent-up grief. But he has slipped back, partly because he's hardly charmed the campaign circuit, and partly because of a shadow cast by sexual harassment claims dating back to 2010. The outsider: Ryan Gosling (La La Land) If Ryan Gosling wins best actor, then La La Land really will be sweeping everything before it. The frontrunner: Viola Davis (Fences) Playing the same role that earned her a Tony Award on Broadway, Viola is, according to the bookies and the pundits, the surest thing in this year's Oscars. The challengers: Naomie Harris (Moonlight), Nicole Kidman (Lion), Octavia Spencer (Hidden Figures) and Michelle Williams (Manchester by the Sea) all gave fine performances. But they needn't bother rehearsing an acceptance speech. The frontrunner: Mahershala Ali (Moonlight) Ali was the standout performer in Moonlight's ensemble. And with a role in Hidden Figures also among his credits, he is another actor the Academy is ready to anoint as a major star. The challenger: Dev Patel (Lion) There's a lot of love and a late surge of support for Patel, who has come of age as an actor eight years after his breakthrough film Slumdog Millionaire won eight Oscars. The outsider: Jeff Bridges (Hell or High Water) He may be supporting, but Bridges steals the show as a wizened, maverick Texas Ranger. The frontrunner: Damian Chazelle (La La Land) La La Land is so beloved by the Academy that they're likely to reward Chazelle's vision and audacity - and the fact he's made a film like this at the age of 32. He would be the youngest best director winner in Oscars history. The challenger: Barry Jenkins (Moonlight) But Moonlight also shows rare directorial acumen and marks the arrival of another major film-making talent in Jenkins, who would be the first African-American winner of this award. The outsider: Mel Gibson (Hacksaw Ridge) It would be a big statement to give the award to the Australian after his exile from Hollywood following notorious anti-Semitic, racist and misogynist outbursts. But then again, the Oscars did give this award to Roman Polanski in 2003, despite his own Hollywood exile after admitting unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl. The magical musical has a record-equalling 14 nominations. That includes two for best song - meaning it can win a maximum of 13 statuettes. The record number of wins in Oscar history is 11 (Titanic, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King and Ben-Hur). The record for a musical is 10 (West Side Story). The hype has cooled a little, so La La Land will do well if it gets into double digits. It's the favourite in 10 of the 13 categories in which it has nominations - the only ones in which it isn't frontrunner are best actor, original screenplay and sound editing. After two years of #OscarsSoWhite, in which there were no non-white acting nominees, three of the four acting trophies could go to black actors this year. If Denzel, Viola and Mahershala all triumph, it will be the first time that black performers will be in the majority when the four acting winners get together for that post-Oscars photo hug. A lot of people, probably, directly or indirectly. There's a whole separate article on this. There is a select group of 12 people who have got what is known as an EGOT - the set of Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony Awards. There's an even more select group of just two people (composers Richard Rodgers and Marvin Hamlisch) who have got a PEGOT - all the above plus a Pulitzer Prize. Lin-Manuel Miranda, who created the Broadway smash Hamilton, currently has a PEGT - he's just missing an O. He's nominated for best song for How Far I'll Go from Moana. La La Land is hot favourite for that prize, of course. But could the fact it has two nominations in that category split the La La vote and let Lin-Manuel sneak in to complete the set? Sound recording engineer Kevin O'Connell notched up his 21st Oscar nomination this year for his sound mixing work on Hacksaw Ridge. That's a great achievement - the shine only coming off it slightly when you consider the fact he's never won. This could be his year. It could. Except La La Land is standing in his way. So it won't. At the nominees' luncheon group photo this year, the Academy placed him in the middle, next to the giant Oscars statuette - and the face he made shows he's past caring. Two British brothers are nominated for best visual effects this year, for different films. Paul Corbould is nominated for Doctor Strange, while Neil Corbould is shortlisted for Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. Neil has won twice before - for Gladiator and Gravity - while Paul, previously nominated for Guardians of the Galaxy, has never won. It's a talented family. There's another visual effects wizard brother, Chris, who won an Oscar for Inception. Fortunately for the sake of preventing further family rivalry, he's not nominated this year.

{"article": "With its half-year results, the new chairman said the move would be complex as it affects the pension scheme. The Edinburgh-based company is under pressure from a German shareholder which has just bought a 7% stake. It wants to split the ground handling operations from the distribution division. The latter has suffered from the downturn in newspaper circulations, down 3.7% in the first half of the year, and magazine sales, down 4.7%. That was partly offset in its six-month results by collectable stickers linked to the UEFA European football championship, and by the expansion into online shopping deliveries. John Menzies is using its overnight newspaper delivery vans for daytime work. It says that efficiency has helped it win a three-year national distribution contract supplying retailer WH Smith. Boardroom tensions led to four members of the board departing earlier this year, including the former chief executive and former finance director. One of the four newly appointed directors is Dr Dermot F Smurfit, who became chairman last month, who told shareholders: \"One of my tasks will be to review the structure of the group in order that we can maximise shareholder value. \"This will include looking at whether our two operating businesses are best placed to prosper while they are part of one group. \"The situation is complex, particularly with regard to our pension schemes. Management have already engaged with specialist advisers and our pension trustees, and work is underway to structure the pension scheme in such a way as to give the board the maximum amount of flexibility in future. I expect this work to take up to 12 months.\" In its results for January to June, John Menzies reported revenue flat at just over Â£1 bn. Profits fell by nearly half to Â£3m. The aviation division moved out of loss, while distribution made a Â£12m profit. The company said the Brexit vote leaves uncertainty, but it hopes to gain from earning 80% of its aviation income in currencies other than sterling, which convert into sterling at rates that help boost results. The company's aviation business operates at 149 airports in 32 countries. Its distribution division employs 3,500 people from 43 different sites across Britain and Ireland, delivering around six million newspapers and magazines each day.

A company statement said: \"Trains may be busy and there will be limited food and drink services onboard. Last trains of the day are likely to leave significantly earlier than usual.\" The dispute centres on staffing and on-board catering facilities on FGW's new fleet of Hitachi Inter City Express trains, with the union fearing guards and buffet cars will be disposed of.

{"article": "The predicted decline is being blamed on schools entering more pupils for the exams a year earlier than intended. Education Secretary Kirsty Williams warned pupils capable of high grades could be missing out by sitting the exams early and not being re-entered. She told BBC Wales she may stop schools entering pupils for exams a year early. Speaking on the Sunday Politics Wales programme, Ms Williams said she would consider the matter after an investigation reports back to her in the autumn. For GCSE English Language, entry data shows a substantial number of pupils taking the qualification this summer while still in year 10. There are slightly more than 21,000 year 10 entries - approximately 65% of all year 10 students in Wales. Exam regulator Qualifications Wales said that as a result \"we expect that this will mean that the overall results this summer will be lower than in previous years\". Ms Williams said: \"What I'm concerned about is that children that, perhaps had the potential to get an A* and A or a B at the end of a two year course end up having to settle for a C because they do it early and they're not re-entered again. \"I want children to fulfil their potential in school. I want early entry to be only for the children who will benefit from it. \"When I see such large numbers as are being reported as being entered, that's something I am concerned about.\" This year, for the first time, pupils have sat GCSE English and Welsh exams which are unique to Wales. Ms Williams said the new qualifications were more rigorous and this could also account for the expected drop in results. However, last October, Qualifications Wales wrote to schools about the new qualifications and insisted: \"There is a well-established approach to maintaining stability in outcomes when a new GCSE or an A level is introduced, known as 'comparable outcomes'. It said the aim was to ensure pupils taking new qualifications were \"neither advantaged nor disadvantaged\" compared to those who took the previous exam, and that the approach \"works well in situations where one specification is replaced with another\". In May, Welsh Government Director of Education Steve Davies told AMs some schools were \"gaming\" the exam system, that officials were \"concerned\" about the volume of early entry and the government wanted to take action this autumn. Earlier in the month, Ms Williams expressed concerns the focus on raising GCSE attainment to C grade had led to \"unintended consequences\", with some children put in for early entry to bank a lower qualification instead of potentially reaching higher. This is an issue which has been on the Welsh Government's radar for a number of years. In 2013, the then Education Minister, Huw Lewis, warned he would intervene to prevent schools \"gaming the system\" in the future if they did not stop voluntarily. In England, the number of pupils being entered early for their Maths GCSEs fell sharply in 2014 when the UK government made changes to how school league tables were calculated so that only the first entry counted.", "question": "English , Welsh and Maths GCSE results are expected to be lower in Wales this year than previously , the @placeholder overseeing qualifications has said .", "option_0": "youth", "option_1": "minister", "option_2": "body", "option_3": "county", "option_4": "officer", "label": 2}

{"article": "They could be at any one of the summer's music festivals. But this is the young farmers' area at the Royal Welsh Agricultural Show, in Powys, Mid-Wales. Despite the huge numbers of enthusiastic young people here, the average age of a farmer is 58. More than 60,000 new farmers will be needed over the next decade in order to provide enough food for the rest of us. Despite unemployment among 16-24-year-olds standing at just over one million, few consider a career in farming where a good one might earn up to £60,000 a year. This is partly because farming has an image problem. A survey of young children carried out by Careers in Farming and Food Supply showed the industry was perceived as \"boring, repetitive and low-paid\". In just one row of stands here at the Royal Welsh, fluttering banners advertise animal micro-nutrients and heavy machinery and offer a multitude of financial plans. This tiny area of the show demonstrates that agriculture has become an increasingly technical, complex and challenging industry. \"You can use all sorts of skills as a farmer these days,\" says Christine Tacon, Chairman of UK Farming plc. Beyond an obvious passion for the outdoors, farmers also need to excel at logistics and planning as well nurturing \"softer\" skills, like people management. \"Imagine you've hired 2,000 workers from various countries in eastern Europe. Getting them to work harmoniously together is going to be a challenge,\" explains Ms Tacon. The shortage of young farmers is also starting to worry big businesses. Fast-food chain McDonalds has also just launched a programme aiming to help young people into the industry. With an initial first-year investment of £1m, Farm Forward offers agricultural students a placement year working in every part of the supply chain. Source: Royal Agricultural Society of England report, 2009 \"We will help them develop the blend of skills and experience that progressive, modern farmers want and need,\" says Brian Mullens, senior vice president of McDonalds UK. Many young people are also put off farming because they think you have to come from an agricultural family to succeed. \"This absolutely isn't true,\" says Rachel Jones, from Farmers Weekly magazine. \"People don't realise how much of a business farming is, you have to have an eye on margins and costs every step of the way. If you have really acute business and entrepreneurial skills there are opportunities out there. \" In a bid to tempt some fresh meat into the industry, Farmers Weekly has launched Farmers Apprentice - a competition in which 10 people aged between 18 and 25 will battle it out in a farming \"boot camp\" for a week, carrying out some of the toughest tasks. Gareth Barlow grew up in Reading, and when his non-farming friends and family found out that his dream was to become a farmer, they tried to put him off. \"They said there was no future in it and I'd never make any money. I guess I wanted to prove them wrong,\" he said. He has continued to add to the small flock of sheep he bought as a 17-year-old, and now has more than 500. Gareth also trained as butcher and has sold his meat to Michelin-starred chefs, like Marcus Wareing. \"Farming has to be a business,\" he says. \"You're a businessman first, then a farmer\". He acknowledges that farming is not always the most glamorous of jobs, and can be very hard work. \"You're working with and against nature,\" he says. \"You have to be prepared to do anything, so if a ewe's having trouble birthing, you do have to get stuck in.\" The recent dairy protests highlight the challenges faced by small farmers in today's volatile markets. They also show how necessary it is to display good business acumen when negotiating prices with supermarkets. The National Farmers Union says cuts in the price paid to suppliers, combined with rising feed costs, could force hundreds of farmers out of business. However, Christine Tacon does not think that should put anyone off the industry. She says in the bigger agricultural companies, graduate trainees are paid upwards of £20,000, are given a vehicle and often a house. Alongside schemes like the Farmers Apprentice and Farm Forward, the industry is trying to do more to change the public perception of farming.

{"article": "\"Just a couple of days ago, I was like, 'I've changed one thing,' and they were like, 'You can't'. And I was like, 'Can you please make this happen because I need it,' and they said, 'OK'. The \"they\" in this anecdote are his record label Sony and the \"thing\" he changed was a track on the band's new album For Crying Out Loud. \"I'm terrible,\" he admits. And the source of his frustration? \"I sped up a track by 1 bpm (beat per minute) because it was doing my head in and I couldn't figure out why. Maybe it's just madness, I can't even decide for myself. \"I get pretty obsessed making albums. I think a lot of people I respect are probably the same, I think it's what binds us.\" While for many, this kind of attention to detail could reek of some kind of music megalomania, or even a bit of rock star posturing designed to prove his self-importance, it's this kind of attention to detail which, to the consternation of hipster tastemakers and serious muso critics, have made the lad-rockers one of the biggest bands in the UK. Fewer than 10 years after playing second fiddle to Razorlight (where are they now?) on the Other Stage at Glastonbury, Kasabian joined Arcade Fire and Metallica as the top billing artists on the Pyramid Stage. That was three years ago and for many British bands, could be considered the peak of their career. \"It was like completing Mario,\" says Pizzorno. \"I didn't get a lull afterwards, I  just thought, 'What does this mean, getting from rehearsing in a shed to headlining Glasto?' It was a long old journey.\" For anyone who has ever witnessed the raucous, sing-a-long atmosphere of a Kasabian gig - midway between a rock show and a football terrace - it would come as a surprise that it's only recently the 36-year-old has begun enjoying their live shows. \"Performing, for me, well I've always been a studio man but I got into the performing thing. Now, I  feel excited about performing which is a new thing.\" Which is just as well as the band are currently in the middle of a UK and European tour which will also see them headline this summer's Reading and Leeds festivals. It also sees them on the verge of releasing their sixth album since 2004's self-titled debut album. In the band's Wikipedia page (\"It's all rubbish, I don't know how they get away with it,\" says the musician), one fact which Serge says is correct is that they have now been together for more than two decades. \"Twenty years is a long time,\" he admits. \"What keeps me going, is I'm obsessed with tunes and you can see it in the eye of other people with the same addiction. Even though you've got a bag of new songs that are ok - you always want one more.\" The new songs, which the band have already played live, at a three-night residency in London's Kentish Town Forum include Comeback Kid, God Bless This Acid House and the already controversial You're in Love with a Psycho with its nonsensical lyrics - \"The doctors say I'm crazy, that I'm eight miles thick / I'm like the taste of macaroni on a seafood stick.\" \"It's not the shower scene from Hitchcock,\" explains Serge. \"I think in any relationship there are moments when one of you will do something and the other will think, 'Whoa... that was a bit weird, I only forgot to put the bins out, come on, is it that bad?' \"It made me laugh and originally it was, 'I'm in love...' but I looked at my wife and thought I can't do that. It could be about anyone but I have had a few texts from my mates asking is that about my missus?\" So, in that spirit, what do the new song titles from For Crying Out Loud tell us about Serge, we decided to have a gentle probe... You know what, I'd abdicate and I'd go to a desert island with all the money that I'd stashed away and I'd go with a record player and a case of rum and sit there with no one else. That would be my day. I'd take a crate and have my favourite albums but then I'd have a mystery crate so I could dig away at that. Paddy Considine in Dead Man's Shoes, that is the epitome. He's the best. The longest would have been going out Friday and going to bed Sunday night, which is not bad, two and a half days. Actually,  it did go into Monday so three days-ish but I would never do it again. The Friday was great and it carried on and the Saturday was okay but the Sunday was not good and it wasn't for want of trying to go to bed. In a fight, it would be horrendous. Tom would win, well it depends. I think if Tom got in early, he'd get the knockout but if it went past eight rounds, I think I've got the stamina. But if he went in early, I think he'd do it. I'd probably do him on points. One year, it was the Champions League when Arsenal played Barcelona and I went round the corner to watch it with Noel Gallagher and I had to catch a train and I was with Tom and so we got there before the game and I think we had maybe five or six pints of [generic beer brand] over the period, I mean it was ridiculous because we had to catch a train and I have never been so out of mind mind trying to catch a train and when we arrived in Leicester, there were a couple of coppers waiting for us. We weren't in trouble but it was just bad. I was so drunk but then an hour later, I wasn't too bad, it was this weird concentrated period. And hangover cure? I wish I knew, I don't have one. There isn't one is there? It's your punishment for having such a good time. There's the obvious one of course (we think he means Oasis) but I'm going to go for something else. It would be nice for the Floyd to get back together. So, Pink Floyd. The best one, just because of the ridiculous situation, not because it was the best party but on the first album when we were kids, we got invited to Philip Green's yacht in Monte Carlo and it was just full of what you would imagine. Like, Bon Jovi were there.  It was the oddest group ever and, as you can imagine, we were like 20, 23 so were trying to get into his helicopter and turn it on. It was just mad. The worst? I can't remember. I've never had a bad party, I'd have a great party in here with just me and you. Us (Leicester City) winning the Premier League. We were playing two shows in the stadium in the summer and I remember leaving a game against Swansea and spoke to our manager and said, 'We've got to move those gigs'. It was impossible because we had six weeks to turn it around but we did. Every day, just taking the kids to school, it was just everywhere and it's one of those things in 20 years you'll be on a programme as one of these talking heads, talking about it. It's still too soon to understand what happened. Yeah quite a lot actually and I figured it out. I used to really struggle but audio books are my thing. It's annoying because you fall asleep and can't remember where you got to, so you listen to the same chapter over and over but that's the thing. I need not to think, silence doesn't work and music is terrible because I start writing notes. I'm on podcasts right now. Adam Buxton, he's so good. Oh man.  Do you know what, I'm gonna say Seven Nation Army because it's the first thing that came into my head. How he's managed to write the sporting anthem of the world is hilarious because he had no idea that it would be. When Italy won the world cup I think, and I could be wrong, but I think it started with the Italian fans because that was their song and they won the cup, which was amazing. If I hadn't said Leicester winning the league, I would have said that, so that song brings back happy memories. Man, I could write a soundtrack but I don't know if I have the answers for that. I don't really have anything worth much, I don't really go in for that. Probably my synthesizer collection and I had no idea. Apparently I made a good investment and, at the time, people asked, 'Why are you buying all this old gear that doesn't work?'. But over the years, it's better than buying red wine, I was told.

A second inspection took place on Saturday, coastguard spokesman Commander Armand Balilo told AFP news agency. He said the crew of 21 had been \"very cooperative\". Ocean Maritime Management was blacklisted by the UN Security Council in 2014 after one of its ships was seized in July 2013 near the Panama Canal with Cuban weapons hidden under sugar sacks. It was accused last year of renaming and reflagging its vessels to evade asset freezes. The Jin Teng was sailing under a Sierra Leone flag.

{"article": "Not long before they died, convicted drug traffickers Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran expressed a wish for a global campaign to abolish the death penalty. They had spent 10 long years in Indonesian prisons after being convicted in 2006 of playing a major role in the so-called Bali Nine drug ring that attempted to smuggle more than 18lb (8.2kg) of heroin from Indonesia to Australia. By all accounts, they had worked hard to rehabilitate themselves: Chan had qualified as a pastor and ministered to fellow inmates. Sukumaran found solace in art. His talent for painting earned him an associate degree in fine arts from Western Australia's Curtin University two months before his execution. Those changes slowly won them the sympathy of many Australians. Now, their desire to see more action on the death penalty is being taken up by some of the country's top politicians. Devastated by the failure of frantic diplomatic and legal bids to save their lives, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop last week said \"it is time for us to have a significant discussion about the application of the death penalty for drug offences in our region\". Former Attorney General Philip Ruddock has taken the campaign a step further. He has written to the local diplomats of countries such as Brazil, France and Nigeria, whose nationals were executed this year by Indonesia or are on death row there. Co-chair of Australian Parliamentarians against the Death Penalty, Mr Ruddock wants them to work with Australia on abolishing the death penalty in and beyond the region, including in the United States. \"I think it is timely that Australia indicates it has a principled position on this matter and that we're prepared to be on the front foot in advocating change,\" Mr Ruddock told the BBC. But Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce, who is charged with managing sensitive trade issues with Indonesia, says Australia might have to look into its own backyard as well as trying to influence others. \"I have to be honest, I do get approached by people saying, 'Well, that might be your view, Barnaby, that you don't support the death penalty, but it's not our view',\" he told ABC television. \"And I find that rather startling at times and I think that the discussion that we're having about others, we should also be carrying out domestically.\" Australia has a long-standing bipartisan opposition to capital punishment and has not executed anyone since 1967. But the nation's leaders at times send mixed messages about the death penalty. Comments by former Prime Minister John Howard in 2007 about the ringleaders of the 2002 Bali bombings, which killed 202 people, are a prime example. \"The idea that we would plead for the deferral of executions of people who murdered 88 Australians is distasteful to the entire community,\" he said. However, Australians' acceptance of the use of the death penalty by other countries has fallen in recent years. A  1986 poll found more than 70% believed it should be carried out if Australians were sentenced to death in another country, says Lowy Institute for International Policy polling director Alex Oliver. But a Lowy poll conducted in February this year showed nearly a complete reversal:  62% of people did not want Chan and Sukumaran to be executed, and nearly 70% believed the death penalty should not be used to punish drug traffickers. Another poll, in 2010, found that nearly 60% of people wanted Australia to push for abolition of the death penalty in South East Asia.  Ms Oliver expects to see similar sentiments in a poll conducted at the weekend about the latest executions, to be published later this week. \"The last 35 years have seen a strengthening opposition to the death penalty generally,\" she says. However, she says views can change depending on who is facing capital punishment and what their crime is. Most people hold inconsistent views on the death penalty, says Patrick Stokes, Senior Lecturer in Philosophy at Melbourne's Deakin University. \"Most people don't like the death penalty but think maybe certain people should be put to death, or they don't want the death penalty here but are less concerned about overseas, or they don't like the thought of Australians being executed, say, in China or Malaysia or Indonesia but are not concerned about it being applied in places like the US, or Iran or Japan or Saudi Arabia,\" he says. \"It's an area where most people don't have a clear, principled position but a fragmented reaction to cases as they arrive.\" Working harder to abolish the death penalty rather than just winning a reprieve for sentenced Australians would shield Australia from accusations of hypocrisy or \"special pleading\", says Lowy executive director Dr Michael Fullilove. Asia is the obvious place for Australia to begin - it is home to \"the world's worst offenders\" on capital punishment, like China.  Mr Fullilove says Australia should forge a regional alliance with countries in the region that have abolished the death penalty: Cambodia, Nepal, East Timor, Bhutan and the Philippines. It should also make the issue not just a principle, but a priority. \"We should aim to become a leader in the international movement against the death penalty,\" he says.", "question": "Momentum is gathering in Australia to push for the elimination of the death penalty around the world but some say Australians should address @placeholder in their own backyard first .", "option_0": "rise", "option_1": "attitudes", "option_2": "rule", "option_3": "violence", "option_4": "evidence", "label": 1}

Officers across 10 London boroughs are currently involved in the trial using about 1,000 devices, to boost transparency and speed up convictions, with aims for a further 20,000 to be used by March next year. Often placed just below the shoulder the camera can be obscured if the officer raises their arm to aim a weapon.

{"article": "The claim: Regional governments in Belgium have held up the EU's trade deal with Canada and would be likely to do the same to the UK. Reality check verdict: Not all EU trade deals need to be approved by individual member states, but bigger ones do. If the UK were to agree a wide-ranging deal, including provisions on things like services, transport or investor protection, it would need to be ratified by every member state. In the case of Belgium, that would mean any of the five local parliaments could scupper it. A Brussels signing ceremony was scheduled for Thursday, with Canadian ministers invited to attend. Now it looks unlikely. The hitch is that Ceta requires ratification by all the 28 member states' national parliaments and 10 regional parliaments. Under Belgian rules, the national government cannot sign the deal unless all five local governments agree to it. The parliament of Wallonia, the French-speaking region of Belgium, rejected the deal, as did the Brussels city parliament and that of the wider French-speaking community. The federal government and those representing the German community and Dutch-speaking Flanders approved the deal. As a result, Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel has said the Belgian government cannot sign the deal off. Walloon leaders have asked for more time to study Ceta, suggesting a possible compromise may be found further down the line. So what does this tell us about the Brexit negotiations? EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said: \"If we can't make it with Canada, I don't think we can make it with the UK.\" Not all EU agreements need to be ratified by all member states. If agreements only cover areas that are the responsibility of the EU, such as tariffs, then they do not need to be ratified in this way. Senior EU politicians have suggested that setting out the terms of the UK's withdrawal and a new trade relationship between the UK and the EU would require two separate agreements. The first agreement, the divorce settlement under Article 50, could well be done without needing ratification by all the individual member states. That's because they would be agreed by qualified majority voting, which means having the support of 20 out of 27 countries representing at least 65% of the EU's population. But the second deal, covering the UK's future trade relationship with the EU, would be more difficult to conclude without the approval of all the members. The more complex the trade deal is, the more likely it is that it would be a \"mixed\" trade deal. A \"mixed deal\" is an EU deal that includes areas that the individual EU states take decisions on, for example services, transport or investor protection. The list of areas that the member states themselves have a say on can be found here. \"Far from having taken back control, we will have left ourselves at the whim of the internal politics of 27 other countries,\" said Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson Tom Brake. Ceta is a mixed deal, as was the EU's deal with South Korea. The customs union with Turkey was not a mixed deal, so did not need to be ratified by all member states. It is important to stress that we know very little so far about what the UK's deal or deals to leave the EU will look like. We do not know what the UK's or the EU's starting positions are, let alone what the two sides would eventually agree on. And if the trade deal is conducted outside the legal framework of Article 50, which envisages a two-year deadline, extendable only by a unanimous agreement of the other 27 EU countries, then we will not know any details of the deal for many years to come.", "question": "The European Union has been negotiating a trade deal with Canada @placeholder Ceta for the past seven years .", "option_0": "relegated", "option_1": "gathering", "option_2": "preferred", "option_3": "called", "option_4": "rules", "label": 3}

A correspondent for AFP news agency in Bouake said on Sunday that there had been no firing there since Saturday evening. \"Traffic has resumed this morning and the shops have reopened.\" Ivory Coast profile The mutiny began in Bouake early on Friday with soldiers firing rocket-launchers.  On Saturday soldiers took over the army headquarters in Abidjan. Protests also took place in the cities of Man, Daloa, Daoukro, Odienne and Korhogo.

{"article": "There are conveyor belts and fast moving robots, but this isn't a car factory. Instead this is the modern face of blood testing. Tiny phials of blood are whizzing around the room being tested by a variety of automated machines. All around people in lab coats are bustling to keep everything running smoothly. Thousands of blood and urine samples whizz though facilities like this in many of our major hospitals. It is an extremely efficient service; nevertheless from a GP taking a sample to getting a result can still take a couple of days. Now a new invention from scientists at the University of Birmingham aims to move some of that testing out of the lab and into your GP's surgery or High Street chemist and to cut that testing time from days to just a minute. Although this new test can be retooled to look for many different things, the team from Birmingham are focusing their initial efforts on to urinary tract infections (UTIs). This will create a simple test that can detect infection in a patient's urine and also further check to see if the infection is resistant to common antibiotics. Currently if you go to your doctor with a UTI, he or she will send a sample off to the local lab for testing and, in the meantime, start you on a course of antibiotics. Of course when the result comes back in a couple of days it may show that particular infection is resistant to the antibiotic the doctor gave you. That means you need to start over with a different antibiotic and it will take longer to clear things up. But there's a bigger problem. Although the initial medicine won't have had any impact on your infection, the antibiotic it contains could come into contact with other bugs in your body and they may go on to develop a resistance to it, fuelling the more general problem of antibiotic resistance. But with this test you can avoid all this and instead discover in a minute if you are infected and which antibiotics will work against the infection. So how does it work? Well, long straight molecules called bacteriophage M13 are mixed with the urine sample from the patient. Usually they sit in nice straight lines like dried spaghetti in a packet. But they are designed to \"lock on\" to any infection and, when they do, they go from nice straight lines to big clumps. This change is detected and that gives the result. This research started at the University of Birmingham and has now been spun-out into a new company called Linear Diagnostics based on campus at the Biohub. You can read more about the research here. Excitingly, you can tweak the molecules so they lock on to all sorts. In this new test that means they can detect infection and also antibiotic resistance. But the hope is this simple idea could be expanded to test for many other diseases. For now though the focus is on UTIs and clinical trials start in hospitals soon, with the aim of having a test on the market by the end of the year. It means patients should get better, more targeted treatment, clearing up the infection faster. But it's also a useful new tool in a the bigger battle against the growing problem of antibiotic resistance.", "question": "I 'm standing next to what looks like a highly automated @placeholder line .", "option_0": "group", "option_1": "production", "option_2": "telephone", "option_3": "heart", "option_4": "health", "label": 1}

The smell of grilled meat and crispy bread mixes in the early spring breeze. These shops coexist uneasily with the neighbouring Lebanese businesses. \"Look around you. It feels like the Hamidieh market,\" laments Fouad Araji, a Lebanese restaurant owner. Hamidieh is the famous Syrian souk at the heart of the old city in Damascus, over 50km (30 miles) away from Barelias. Mr Araji says his profits are down by about 40%. He blames the new Syrian shops in the area for his losses. Barelias is a mainly Sunni town of around 35,000 residents. Its proximity to the Masnaa crossing, one of the main points into and out of Syria, makes it an attractive destination for Syrians fleeing the violence across the border. According to the mayor of the town, Naji al-Mays, 15,000 Syrians are currently living in Barelias. \"Discontent at the impact of the Syrian presence is growing,\" says Mr Mays in a worried tone. These complaints are echoed at the highest levels. Wael Abu Faour, the minister of social affairs, describes the refugee crisis as \"the biggest challenge facing Lebanon\". \"It's becoming a huge burden on the political, demographic, security and social levels\", he said. Source: UNHCR Mr Abu Faour speaks of rising tension between the Syrian refugees and the local communities. \"Even in areas highly supportive of the Syrian revolution, people are complaining. In some cases there have been some clashes and unfortunately, we're hearing about attacks against Syrians in the country\". In some areas, negative attitudes towards the Syrians have surfaced. At the entrance to Botchay, a small Christian town on Mount Lebanon, visitors are greeted by an unusual message. A large banner reads: \"The municipality of Botchay announces a daily curfew on foreigners from 8.30 PM to 5.30 AM.\" \"By foreigners I mean Syrians. But I've worded it such that I wouldn't be branded a racist,\" says Michel Khoury, the mayor of Botchay and the man behind the decision. \"I've imposed the curfew as a pre-emptive measure. Every day, we hear about security incidents, crimes, burglaries, intimidation and so on in areas all over the country. So I've taken this initiative to protect my town,\" he said proudly. There are no camps for refugees in Lebanon. Instead, they stay in rented apartments or with relations. The UNHCR says as of the end of March, about 400,000 Syrian refugees had been registered, or were awaiting registration, in Lebanon. But the Lebanese Minister of Interior, Marwan Charbel, says that the real number of Syrians in Lebanon is almost a million. Lebanon's entire population is estimated at four million. According to Mr Charbel, the crime rate in Lebanon has increased by about 50%, an increase he says is related to the influx of Syrians. These statements are undoubtedly feeding social anxiety in the small country with overstretched resources. Lebanon already hosts more than 450,000 Palestinian refugees. The country suffered a 15-year civil war, ending in 1990. Demographic changes or tensions are a hugely sensitive issue. Yara Shhayed from the Anti-Racism Movement, argues that the attitudes towards Syrian refugees are akin to racism. She says that they are being blamed \"only because they're the weakest link\". \"People here have always looked down on Syrian workers. But since the start of the conflict in Syria and the influx that ensued, the Lebanese have been wanting to make Syrians pay for their own political failures,\" she said. \"So if the crime rate is high because of loose security or if dire economic conditions drive people to steal, they say that the thieves are Syrians and the rapists are Syrians and so on.\" The Lebanese government has been slow dealing with the refugee crisis. While it has facilitated the entrance of Syrian refugees, it was late to conceive a plan to deal with their needs.

{"article": "What the PM described yesterday as \"Brussels gossip\", now this morning has been more firmly dismissed by Number 10, claiming \"we really, really don't recognise these reports\" (Not precisely the same rebuttal). Of course, no politician would wanted to be branded \"delusional\", or indeed, \"ignorant\" or \"misunderstanding\", or to have a blow-by-blow account of just how awkward and unproductive a vital private dinner about the future of your country was. Not least Theresa May who is someone who does her homework, makes careful plans, and takes \"getting on with the job\", one of her favourite phrases, extremely seriously. The proactive and critical briefing against Number 10 after the meeting between the PM and some of the EU's top officials, Jean Claude Juncker and Michel Barnier, last week, has, unsurprisingly, spilled into the election campaign and onto some of this morning's front pages. Overnight, my BBC colleagues in Brussels have been told the UK was on a \"different wavelength\" and \"misunderstanding\" of how the EU works. The message from the EU is not really very different from what has been said in Brussels for many months. The UK has been told repeatedly that the EU will stick together, that nothing can be agreed until everything is agreed, and also that parallel talks on trade and the exit deal are extremely unlikely. Indeed, the prospect that the talks could fail has also been a distinct possibility. And it can't be said too many times, there will be spin on both sides of this negotiation, right up until, and including the end of the process. Neither side right now wants be seen as willing to give ground. And like it or not, spin is part of the armoury on both sides. But the briefings have extra charge during the febrile atmosphere of the election campaign. Privately in March, ministers in the UK believed the EU was softening its approach, hoping that some countries could come alongside, against what they consider the rigid approach of the EU institutions. The accusations being hurled around now, even the public statement from the EU's most powerful politician, Angela Merkel, that some in the UK have \"illusions\" don't augur well for the negotiations. And the comments will be used again and again by Theresa May's political opponents to claim she is out of her depth and has no realistic plan for Brexit. Stand by, however, to watch Number 10 try to flip it on its head, to use the very obvious challenges ahead as ammunition in her central election argument  - precisely because the talks will be tricky, it's vital that she has her own strong, negotiating mandate they claim. Although diplomats like to (mis)quote the 19th century general, Helmuth Von Moltke, that no plan, however good, survives its first contact with the enemy, and the chances of the EU agreeing all of Downing Street's approach are as skinny as a skelf, since the trigger of Article 50, the signs are not rosy. These leaks from last week's dinner a sign that parts of the EU are willing to play rough. The question is, whether over time, if she ends up back in Number 10, Theresa May's determination can shift them. Or whether up against 27 in talks, she is brutally outnumbered from the start.", "question": "Conservative sources have @placeholder to enter into a \" briefing war \" with Brussels .", "option_0": "voted", "option_1": "launched", "option_2": "agreed", "option_3": "forced", "option_4": "declined", "label": 4}

Iowa State University mechanical engineering professor Reza Montazami said it was the first practical transient battery. While this particular battery could not be used in the human body as it contain lithium, researchers have been examining how batteries could dissolve harmlessly within the human body, and prevent the pain of removal, for several years. Prof Montazami developed the lithium-ion battery with a team of scientists who recently published details of their discovery in the Journal of Polymer Science, Part B: Polymer Physics. It measures 5mm in length, is 1mm thick and 6mm wide, and is similar to commercial batteries in terms of its components, structure and electrochemical reactions. It contains an anode, cathode and an electrolyte separator within two layers of polyvinyl alcohol-based polymer. When dropped in water, the battery's polymer casing swells and the electrodes are broken apart, causing it to dissolve. However, it contains nanoparticles which do not degrade, meaning it does not dissolve entirely. The entire process takes around half an hour. \"Unlike conventional electronics that are designed to last for extensive periods of time, a key and unique attribute of transient electronics is to operate over a typically short and well-defined period, and undergo fast and, ideally, complete self-deconstruction and vanish when transiency is triggered,\" the scientific paper stated. While it would be possible to create a more powerful battery, it would take longer to break down. Dissolvable batteries could play a part in helping to reduce the waste caused by discarded electronics. Researchers at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign are working on electronic circuit boards capable of dissolving in water. Once in a landfill site, the boards could break down within three to six months, according to the University's prof John Rogers.", "question": "Scientists have developed a self - destructing battery capable of dissolving when exposed to heat or @placeholder .", "option_0": "fun", "option_1": "supplies", "option_2": "cold", "option_3": "liquid", "option_4": "oceans", "label": 3}
{"article": "The Public Accounts Committee said the NHS was struggling to meet waiting time standards and had reduced resources. UK cancer survival rates, while improving, were poor compared with the rest of Europe, the report said. NHS England said it was already working on a new five-year strategy. The report, published following evidence from a number of cancer charities and experts, looked at what progress had been made in improving cancer services and outcomes in England. Margaret Hodge, who chairs the committee, said: \"With more than one in three people developing cancer in their lifetime, cancer touches the lives of all of us at some point, and the Department of Health spends over Â£6.7bn on cancer services a year. \"That is why it is so concerning that the Department of Health and NHS England have lost momentum in the drive to improve cancer services in the last two years. \"More and more people are getting cancer but the resources available to support improvement have gone down.\" The report said that despite a good record in improving cancer services, progress had dipped recently. Cancer waiting time targets, for example, had been missed. The NHS target that 85% of cancer patients should be treated within 62 days of being urgently referred by their GP was missed for the first three-quarters of 2014. As a result, 5,500 patients had to wait longer than 62 days for treatment between July and September last year. Two other cancer waiting time targets were also missed at times during 2014, the report said. It also said it was not good enough that in the UK nearly a third of people died within a year of a cancer diagnosis and about half did not survive for five years. The committee also had issues with \"poor\" survival rates and access to treatment for people over 65. Sean Duffy, national clinical director for cancer at NHS England, said the NHS was helping more people than ever survive cancer. But he acknowledged it was time to take \"a fresh look at how we can do even better across the whole patient journey\". \"This is why we have already established an independent taskforce to develop a new cancer strategy for the next five years.\" The taskforce, announced by NHS England in January, will focus on better prevention, faster diagnosis and better treatment, care and aftercare. Sarah Woolnough, executive director of policy at Cancer Research UK, said: \"It is depressing that too many patients are waiting longer than they should for their diagnosis and effective treatment. \"We hope the report will urgently catalyse NHS England, the Department of Health and others charged with providing cancer care to deliver the best for all patients, no matter their age, the cancer they suffer from or where they live. \"All patients deserve the best treatment and care and many are not currently receiving it.\" She said more people were surviving cancer thanks to the ability to diagnose patients earlier and treat them effectively. But with an ageing population, more people would inevitably develop cancer. To continue to improve cancer services, the right leadership, more investment and better planning was needed now, she said. Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said: \"This report makes devastating reading for David Cameron and is damning proof of his mismanagement of the NHS. Under the Tories, cancer care has gone backwards and patients are missing out on the treatment they need.\" A Department of Health spokesperson said an estimated 12,000 extra people would survive cancer by the end of 2015. \"We have invested an extra Â£750m on cancer services, including early diagnosis and innovative radiotherapy.\"", "question": "The push to improve cancer services in England has \" lost momentum \" in the past two years and the NHS must @placeholder to cope with demand , says a report by a group of MPs .", "option_0": "continue", "option_1": "try", "option_2": "deal", "option_3": "adapt", "option_4": "race", "label": 3}
{"article": "Mrs May said the convention, which is separate from the EU, \"can bind the hands of Parliament\". David Cameron has previously refused to rule out leaving the convention. Ex-cabinet minister and Leave campaigner Iain Duncan Smith said her \"remarkable intervention\" had \"utterly undermined\" the government's position. In her first major speech of the referendum campaign, Mrs May said the UK had to \"stand tall and lead in Europe\" rather than leaving the EU, and that membership made the UK  \"more secure from crime and terrorism\". She also raised concerns about more countries joining the EU. The ECHR, which is separate from the EU institutions, was incorporated into UK law by the Human Rights Act. The Conservatives have pledged to replace the Human Rights Act with a \"British Bill of Rights\" but have not proposed leaving the convention altogether. BBC political editor The home secretary is one of the most senior politicians in the country. Of course, her backing of the Remain campaign is important. And it's certainly better for the prime minister and the Remain campaign to have her In, rather than Out. But her qualified support suggests there are three, rather than two, positions at the top of the Conservative party - 'Remain', 'Leave', and perhaps now, 'Reluctant Remain'. It was the Out campaign struggling to contain their internal differences. Tonight, it feels like cracks might appear on the other side too. Read more from Laura A Downing Street spokeswoman urged journalists not to \"overdo the differences\" between the prime minister and the home secretary on withdrawal from the ECHR. She said Mr Cameron \"rules nothing out\" as he seeks reform of the convention, saying the home secretary had been \"setting out a clear distinction between the ECHR and the EU\". Regardless of the outcome of the 23 June EU referendum, Mrs May said she still believed the UK should leave the ECHR which she said \"adds nothing to our prosperity\". It was the ECHR, not the EU, that was responsible for controversial human rights decision affecting the UK, she said. Earlier pro-Leave Justice Secretary Michael Gove  warned that five potential new members of the EU - Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, Albania and Turkey - would result in millions more people having the right to move to the UK. Mrs May said Albania, Serbia and Turkey had \"poor populations and serious problems with organised crime, corruption, and sometimes even terrorism\". She added: \"We have to ask ourselves, is it really right that the EU should just continue to expand, conferring upon all new member states all the rights of membership?\" She said the UK had \"forgotten how to lead\" in Europe and must re-assert itself to force change from within, adding that it could veto Turkey joining the EU. In her speech - and during a question and answer session - Mrs May admitted that being in the EU made it harder to control the \"volume of immigration\". But she said the UK was able to control its border by blocking entry to terrorists. She praised David Cameron's leadership in trying to seek a better deal for the UK, but said the UK's collective posture was too often to \"blame Europe\" for its problems and the UK \"has to have more confidence to get things done\" rather than \"shouting from the sidelines\". Mrs May said the issue the British public faced on 23 June was how the UK \"maximised\" its \"prosperity, security, influence and sovereignty\". In what she said was an analysis of \"the risks and opportunities\" of EU membership rather than an attack on Leave campaigners, she said the post-war order had seen the UK and other countries \"cede sovereignty in a controlled way\" by co-operating to prevent a greater loss of sovereignty through military conflict or economic decline. Mrs May said the question was not whether the UK could \"survive\" outside the EU given that it was the world's fifth largest economy which had \"friendships and alliances across the world\" - but whether the UK was \"better off in or out\". While \"the sky would not fall\" in the event of Brexit, she said she had concluded it was a matter of \"hard-headed national interest\" to remain in, based on security, trade and prosperity. On security, she said EU membership enabled the UK to access EU-wide information, such as criminal records, to allow the UK to turn away serious criminals and terrorists at the border, fast-track the extradition of offenders and simplify the deportation of prisoners. The UK had extensive intelligence-sharing with the US and other allies outside the EU, she said but being excluded from the EU-wide information sharing would make the UK \"less safe\". However, she called for major changes to the way the UK did business in the EU, including reducing the power of the European Parliament and the European Court of Justice. Mr Duncan Smith told the BBC the home secretary's comments on the ECHR and EU expansion had \"thrown the gauntlet down\" to the government. On EU expansion, he claimed, the prime minister is \"in favour of extending our borders to Syria\" by allowing Turkey to join the EU. \"She actually basically questions the very campaign she says that she supports,\" he said. \"This is a remarkable intervention. She has really thrown the gauntlet down and undermines the whole of the 'vote stay in' campaign.\" Mr Duncan Smith said immigration was \"out of control\" and free movement of people rules meant the UK had to accept criminals coming into the country. \"An elected government in the UK elected on a platform to reduce immigration right now cannot deliver that because the EU is an open border,\" he told Radio 4's Today. \"You cannot reject anyone unless you can demonstrate categorically that they pose an immediate threat to the life and livelihood of the UK.\"", "question": "Home Secretary Theresa May has said the UK should @placeholder the European Convention on Human Rights while remaining in the European Union .", "option_0": "impose", "option_1": "limit", "option_2": "quit", "option_3": "hold", "option_4": "observe", "label": 2}
{"article": "The 19-year-old student from Cherrywood, South Dublin, has what her specialist doctor calls the \"Arsenal of epilepsy\" and contends with up to 15 convulsions a day which render her unconscious. \"Your whole body is shaking, you can feel your muscles jumping, it feels like everything has been sucked out of you, you can't breathe,\" she says. \"Every single day you lose control.\" Despite having to cope with multiple seizures when she runs, Cooke has won prestigious events including her age group in the Dublin City Marathon and she runs 5km in under 17 minutes. She can often be seen pounding the streets with her running partner, Dr Colin Doherty, who also happens to be her consultant neurologist. But she wasn't always so athletic. Diagnosed at the age of nine with frontal lobe epilepsy, she managed her condition with medication until it deteriorated when puberty hit and her hormones started \"kicking up\". \"I wasn't able to get out of bed. I wasn't able to do anything for myself and couldn't really speak. My Mum was dressing me and showering me,\" she says. Cooke was admitted to Our Lady's Children's Hospital in Crumlin where she remained for 10 months. Despite being involved in numerous medical trials she regressed, lost control of her back and hips, and by the time she was discharged she wasn't able to walk. \"I couldn't hold myself up and was in a wheelchair for about seven months but being a very stubborn person I wanted to prove to people what I could do. \"After a lot of physio I started jogging every day and I started to absolutely love the freedom.\" Cooke now runs every day and says a missed session sees the tiredness and dizziness of her earlier condition return. But running only alleviates her symptoms, it hasn't been a cure. The raised heart rate brought on by running triggers more seizures than if she didn't run, but Cooke says it improves her general well-being which is a negative worth accepting. Her neurologist, Dr Doherty, has also weighed up the pros and cons from a medical perspective. \"There are particular challenges with having epilepsy and long-distance running, but if you're walking you have those challenges too and I think the general benefits outweigh these risks,\" he says. \"If you took the average long-distance runner and measured all their health parameters against somebody who doesn't run you would find, no matter what disease or disorder they carried with them, they're better off.\" If you have a health condition and are thinking about starting to exercise it is always important to consult your doctor first. The brain consists of about three billion cells and all of these cells are active, but they don't fire together - the brain is a de-synchronised machine. The signature of epilepsy is that the cells fire together in a synchronised way. If a million cells fire together that causes a change in behaviour but when all three billion cells fire together you've got a convulsion or a fit. There are about 40 distinct types of epilepsy. In some cases people will just stare blankly, others will wander around in a confused state and there are those who fall to the ground with convulsions. Competitive running was initially a non-starter for Cooke. As soon as she had a convulsion during a race paramedics would withdraw her from the event, but a chance comment at one of her consultations led Doherty to offer himself up as her running partner and he has kept her on track ever since. He says: \"I'm a specialist in epilepsy but my sole role when running with Katie is to stop people from taking her off in an ambulance. I just stand there and say 'Katie's fine, I'm her doctor, she's going to recover'.\" Despite Cooke having so many seizures, the nature of her epilepsy means her body doesn't require any recovery time and she is able to immediately get up and run again. Doherty suspects it is her fitness levels which help with that recovery. Listen to the BBC Ouch talk-show to find out more about Katie Cooke, Dr Colin Doherty and their running partnership. \"Katie is a very serious runner, she trains properly. I'm very confident that this is a really positive experience for her,\" he says. As well as sport and college, Cooke also has to navigate a social life and a relationship with boyfriend Jack, a role most daunting at night when Cooke's seizure's make her scream, thrash around and cause the bed to shake and shudder. Cooke says: \"He's one of the most chilled people I know and he sleeps through my seizures which is a bit weird. He wakes up for the odd one because some are quite violent, and I've slapped him in the face before, but he just falls asleep again.\" In terms of intimacy Cooke says sex doesn't trigger seizures, although a fit can occur at such times, and women often report an increase in convulsions around the time of ovulation and their period. Her night-time seizures can also be accompanied by hallucinations of a shadowy man who she says \"comes for me\" and it is these which leave her most exhausted. \"I don't sleep at all,\" she says. Her education suffered and she missed the majority of secondary school. Despite that, she managed to cram three years worth of curriculum for the Irish Leaving Certificate into one year and secured a place at college to study sports management. Doherty calls her a \"remarkable young woman\" for all she has achieved while handling so many severe convulsions on a daily basis. While for most people, watching Katie drop to the floor mid-run would be alarming Doherty believes being so public about it will help others with the condition. \"We need to facilitate people to live as normal life as possible and they need to be encouraged to do everything,\" he says. \"The biggest barrier is not the safety issue but the perceptions of other people.\" For more Disability News, follow BBC Ouch on Twitter and Facebook, and subscribe to the weekly podcast.", "question": "Among the pack of runners one moment , @placeholder on the ground and frothing at the mouth the next .

{"article": "The Zika forest is not well known in Uganda, and most people will be hard-pushed to tell you where it is. The word itself means overgrown in the local Luganda language. There is dense vegetation, a wide range of trees and lots of small animals. The only people you are likely to meet here are the forest-keeper and his family. They live in a small house made of corrugated iron sheets. The virus was discovered in the forest - then a hub of scientific research in East Africa - in 1947 by accident by Ugandan, American and European scientists working on another viral disease, Yellow Fever. While testing monkeys in the forest the scientists, whose research had been funded for a decade by the Rockefeller Foundation, came across a new microorganism, which they named Zika. Zika: What you need to know 'The worst day of my life' Only two cases of the virus have been confirmed in Uganda in the past seven decades. This is because the types of mosquitoes that would transmit the virus to humans don't often come into contact with the general population, says Dr Julius Lutwama, a leading virologist at the Uganda Virus Research Institute. \"The Aedes we have, Aedes aegypti formosus, normally does not bite humans. And then we have other [mosquitoes] which live in the forests and prefer to bite at dusk and dawn,\" Dr Lutwama adds. This is in contrast to Latin America, where a different sub species, Aedes aegypti aegypti, is spreading the Zika virus. Much of the Zika forest, which is along the highway between the capital Kampala and Entebbe International Airport, has been lost to development projects, as Uganda's population grows. All around it new big houses with freshly tiled roofs are springing up. What's left of it is gazetted for scientific research. Several kilometres up the main road is the Uganda Virus Research Institute. It's a massive campus on a hill overlooking Lake Victoria. Security is tight here because samples of dangerous organisms like Ebola, Yellow Fever and Zika are stored there. This is also the only place in Uganda where you can test for Zika. But as Dr John Kayuma, one of the laboratory managers told me, one of the reasons why there are few recorded cases in Uganda could be because not many people have been tested for it. \"It is possible that there could be several people, or so many people out there with the Zika virus infection, but because many people do not seek treatment in the hospitals, we could be missing out. \"And also the surveillance has probably not picked them out. There's a possibility that there are more cases out there.\" In a few months the government will be starting a study to find out how widespread the Zika virus and other flaviviruses like Yellow Fever, Dengue and West Nile are amongst the population.

{"article": "On the day he agreed to meet us in a shisha bar in Paris, Mokobe comes late. He has gone to support families in Montreuil, an eastern suburb of the capital where reports of paedophilia at a pre-school have caused alarm among African migrants. Moboke uses his celebrity status to raise awareness of issues that are often overlooked. \"It's silly to denounce injustice from a studio without talking to people,\" he says. The 40-year-old calls himself \"100% banlieue\". One of 15 children of a Malian-Mauritanian mother and Malian-Senegalese father, he was born as Mokobe Traore on a housing estate in Vitry-sur-Seine, south-east of Paris. Go-getters in the ghetto His fond memories of growing up there belie the common image of the banlieues as a high-rise wasteland. \"At first there were four of us in two bunk-beds in the bedroom,\" he says.  \"Then we were five, then six.   That meant we could no longer shut the window.\"  When more children came they had to sleep in the living room. \"We used to tell each other stories at night,\" Mokobe recalls. \"We had very little but learned to share and were happy,\" he says. \"You get certain principles and certain values from living in that estate.\" Mokobe has not always highlighted the bright side of living in a banlieue. When he burst onto the rap scene in the 1990s, as part of the hip-hop trio 113, he expressed the frustration aspects of life there: \"We were rebels. We made music to speak about our daily lives, about people like us, and to defend their cause.\" The main problem with immigrant suburbs, he says, is a feeling of marginalisation. \"Isolation can be stifling and lead to eruption. It's like a volcano full of lava. It gets very hot.\" His lyrics have become less angry with age. As success led tours in France and abroad, the sense of being confined faded, and Mokobe's main themes became inclusiveness and openness to the world. Mokobe's first solo album, Mon Afrique (My Africa) released in 2007, explored the complex, but ultimately enriching, cultural heritage of French children of African parents. The main message behind his forthcoming album, On Est Ensemble (We Are Together), is all in the title, he says: \"Regardless of your origins, your culture, your social class, whatever happens, we all live on the same planet. We don't have a choice.\" This simple idea, Mokobe believes, has been undermined by social media. Nowadays people are all too aware of faraway events that divide us, he says. He contrasts this with the small world of his old housing estate, where isolation had at least the virtue of breeding togetherness. \"Blacks, Arabs, Chinese - we were all in it together,\" he says. Brotherhood is one of the values the rapper promotes on his regular visits to banlieues. In schools also lectures children on the need to pay attention in class - particularly in English lessons which he himself neglected as a boy. Even after travelling 20 times to the US over the years and playing in San Francisco, New York and many places in between, he says he is \"hopeless\" at English. \"When I performed at the BET [Black Entertainment Television] Awards in Los Angeles in 2011 I was completely lost,\" he smiles. But his main message to banlieue children is one of hope: \"It's important not to give up, and to have faith in the future.  Childhood friends of mine have become lawyers and doctors.

{"article": "A consultation into measures aimed at combating vandalism and anti-social behaviour in the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park closed on Monday. The Mountaineering Council of Scotland said it had \"serious concerns\" over a proposal to ban camping in some areas. Park bosses said \"atrocious damage\" was being caused by anti-social campers. A 12-week consultation, \"Your Park\", was launched in October in a bid to crack down on damage being caused to the park. Bylaws prohibiting camping without a permit at certain badly affected sites are part of the proposals, along with investment in new facilities and education initiatives. Park bosses say similar measures introduced previously at East Loch Lomond resulted in a marked reduction in problems including littering, fire-raising and vandalism. The two proposed \"management zones\", combined with the existing one at East Loch Lomond, would amount to less than 5% of the 720 square miles the park covers. However, the Mountaineering Council of Scotland and Ramblers Scotland together expressed \"serious concerns\" over the matter, and called on the Scottish government to intervene. Helen Todd, campaigns and policy manager with Ramblers Scotland, said existing laws should be enforced more strictly without introducing new bylaws. She said: \"By criminalising camping and other activities which are perfectly acceptable under Scotland's right to roam legislation, the Park Authority would create immense public confusion over what is acceptable when taking access to our countryside.\" Andrea Partridge, access officer with the Moutaineering Council, added: \"It is truly disgraceful that Scotland's first national park, with a primary purpose to promote public enjoyment of the countryside, is now proposing to remove a right to camp for the responsible majority. \"We acknowledge there is a problem with damage and overuse at certain key locations at busy times of the year, but there has been inadequate provision of camping and associated facilities by the Park Authority to help address this problem.\" Gordon Watson, who this week became the park's chief executive having formerly served as director of operations, said such complaints did not take \"the real situation on the ground\" into account. He said: \"We understand that there is strong feeling on the part of outdoors enthusiasts about their right to roam. \"However, some of the arguments presented seem intent on downplaying the atrocious damage that is being caused to the environment of a national park, as well as the impact on residents and visitors. \"Enforcement of existing law already happens, but this is not deterring the problems as bylaws have done on East Loch Lomond. \"The many residents and visitors affected by these problems are impatient for action and rightly expect us to come up with effective solutions. \"The National Park Act gives us bylaw-making powers for a reason - we are expected to protect the environment from damaging overuse and abuse.\" With the consultation now closed, Mr Watson said the park board would consider responses \"fully and carefully\" before making an proposal to the Scottish government.", "question": "Hillwalking and mountaineering groups have joined together to hit out at a @placeholder camping ban in parts of a Scottish national park .", "option_0": "scrap", "option_1": "deal", "option_2": "planned", "option_3": "level", "option_4": "growing", "label": 2}

But it criticises other leaders, including those of Turkey, Hungary and the Philippines, who it says have used narratives of fear, blame and division. The group also says governments are exploiting refugees for political ends. The report, which covers 159 countries, cited a rise in hate speech across the US and Europe targeting refugees and said the reverberations would see more attacks on people on the basis of race, gender, nationality and religion. It criticised countries that, it said, once claimed to champion rights abroad and that were now rolling back human rights at home. \"Instead of fighting for people's rights, too many leaders have adopted a dehumanizing agenda for political expediency,\" Salil Shetty, secretary general of Amnesty International, said in a statement. \"The limits of what is acceptable have shifted. Politicians are shamelessly and actively legitimizing all sorts of hateful rhetoric and policies based on people's identity: misogyny, racism and homophobia.\" The group made special reference to Mr Trump's executive order last month that banned refugees and immigrants from seven mostly Muslim countries from entering the US. It said Mr Trump put \"his hateful xenophobic pre-election rhetoric\" into action by signing the measure. The US president, who recently said he was the \"least racist\" and \"least anti-Semitic person\", is expected to unveil an updated order this week. But Amnesty also mentioned Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban as leaders who were using the \"us versus them\" rhetoric. \"2016 was the year when the cynical use of 'us vs them' narratives of blame, hate and fear took on a global prominence to a level not seen since the 1930s,\" Mr Shetty added, citing the year when Adolf Hitler rose to power in Germany. \"A new world order where human rights are portrayed as a barrier to national interests makes the ability to tackle mass atrocities dangerously low, leaving the door open to abuses reminiscent of the darkest times of human history.\" Kate Allen, director of Amnesty UK, criticised as \"shameful\" the recent decision by the British government to halt the scheme which allowed the entry of unaccompanied refugee children already in Europe, estimated to be 90,000. The group also cited in its report: The London-based group exceptionally launched its report in Paris, saying that France has seen an erosion of its rights in the name of security.

{"article": "Mr Gibb will say he makes \"no apology for expecting every child\" to have a \"high-quality education\". The Conservative manifesto pledged that all pupils would take GCSEs in English, maths, science, a language and either history or geography. Heads' leader Brian Lightman says it will be \"challenging\" for schools. The schools minister will also warn that \"textbooks are now a rare sight in English classrooms\", with only 10% of primary maths teachers using them. He says he will challenge \"textbook publishers to do better\" in producing good quality resources for classrooms. Mr Gibb, in a speech later, will argue that \"knowledge is power\" and that it is the most disadvantaged who are in greatest need of a rigorous academic education. The schools minister will argue that there has been a dishonest pattern of poorer students being encouraged to take \"less demanding qualifications\", which allowed the \"powers that be\" to say that overall standards were rising. The Conservatives' election manifesto said that pupils would have to study GCSEs in the so-called EBacc subjects - English, maths, science, a language and history or geography. And that if schools did not offer them, they would not be eligible for a top Ofsted rating. This would not apply to pupils with special needs. Mr Gibb will acknowledge that this will be a \"significant challenge\" for schools, with 39% of pupils currently entering all these subjects and 24% getting a good grade in all of them. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan had spoken during the election campaign of the need for schools to have more stability and less constant change. And her schools minister is expected to say that he will listen to school leaders before introducing the requirement - with the details of how this will be implemented still to be announced. \"We will ensure that schools have adequate lead-in time to prepare for any major changes,\" Mr Gibb is expected to say. \"We will support these schools to raise standards but make no apology for expecting every child to receive a high-quality core academic education.\" Mr Gibb will argue that access to a strong academic education is the key to social mobility and his proposals will \"provide the foundations of an education system with social justice at its heart\". He said it was \"pernicious\" to suggest that \"a core academic curriculum represents a kind of elitism\". But he will also acknowledge the temptation to keep adding extra requirements to the school timetable - and that this will always mean that something else will be reduced. As a minister, he says, he has been lobbied to add subjects from Esperanto to den building. Brian Lightman, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, said that the key question would be how the changes were implemented and he welcomed the commitment to talks about how this would work in practice. \"It's enormously challenging, but we recognise the importance of a broad academic education for all young people,\" said Mr Lightman.", "question": "All secondary school pupils in England will have to take GCSEs in core academic subjects , under plans to be @placeholder out by Schools Minister Nick Gibb .", "option_0": "wiped", "option_1": "handed", "option_2": "phased", "option_3": "thrown", "option_4": "set", "label": 4}

{"article": "Transport Minister Humza Yousaf said the Scottish government would hold a consultation on changes to the national concession travel scheme. He wants to extend it to Modern Apprentices and those on Job Grants and said people who already had passes would retain them. But he said ministers had to look at the \"long-term sustainability\" of offering all those over 60 free travel. The Scotland-wide free bus pass entitlement scheme was introduced in 2006. The card allows passengers, aged over 60 or disabled, to travel free on local, registered or scheduled long-distance services. The transport minister has said a public consultation on changes to the current system will be held. However, he insisted that current holders of the passes would be unaffected. Mr Yousaf told BBC Scotland: \"If you've got a free bus pass you will continue to have that free bus pass and continue to be able to use that pass in the way that you currently are. \"What we have said is that we want to extend the national travel scheme to Modern Apprentices, to those on a Job Grant, so that some young people, that are in the most need, can also benefit. \"But clearly people are living longer, they are staying in work longer - which are all good things - but it does add a pressure. \"So we will consult on the long-term sustainability of the national concession travel scheme and we look forward to hearing people's views.\" Asked if the consultation was likely to result in a rise in the age at which people will qualify for free travel, the transport minister said: \"I don't want to pre-empt any consultation. \"We are getting continued cuts from the Westminster government and we have to make sure our budgets go further. \"So if you have a pass you will absolutely continue to have that pass.

He was found at about 0100 EST (0600 GMT) on Friday in \"full clown costume\" and mask crouching among trees by an apartment complex, according to police. Recent reports of clowns trying to lure children into woods have sparked alarm. Police have warned individuals against dressing up in clown costumes, adding it could lead to criminal charges. \"Dressing as a clown and driving, walking or standing in public can create a dangerous situation for you and others,\" police in nearby Barbourville, Kentucky, said in a statement online. \"While dressing up is not, in and of itself against the law, doing so in public and thereby creating an unnecessary sense of alarm is illegal.\" Why are clowns scary? Alleged clown encounters have been reported in recent weeks in North Carolina, South Carolina, Alabama, Georgia and Kentucky. But the recent wave of creepy clown sightings has also led to a string of false reports to both police and on social media. Police in Annapolis, Maryland, recently found reports of students being scared by clowns on the way to school to be untrue. A 24-year-old man was charged with making false reports in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, after he told police a clown knocked on his window. Meanwhile, an 11-year-old girl was arrested in Athens, Georgia, for bringing a knife to school because she was scared by social media reports that clowns were attacking children.

The man who called him that was America's Republican presidential candidate, Donald Trump. \"Oh, Donald Trump, oh my God,\" exclaims Kirkorov, when I mention the tycoon's name. \"First time we met, we had a feeling we know each other many, many years!\" The two men have indeed known each other for more than two decades. In 1994, Kirkorov and his ex-wife Alla Pugacheva performed at Trump's Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City. \"After the show Donald Trump came to our dressing room. We got a big, fantastic gold trophy from him and his organisation for being the first Russian artists to play the Taj Mahal. When Alla and I divorced, I kept the trophy!\" In 2013, when Donald Trump brought the Miss Universe Contest to Moscow, Kirkorov was one of the judges. He has been a guest in the Republican candidate's home. A President Trump, he believes, would be Russia's friend. \"He was very often a guest of Russia, he loves Russia and Russians,\" Kirkorov tells me. \"If Trump will be President, the relationship between our countries will be much closer. And I pray for that. Because we are two big countries, two big nations. We must be friends.\" Kirkorov's famous friend is singing from the same hymnbook. Wouldn't it be nice if we actually got along with people? Wouldn't it be nice if we got along with Russia?\" \"If we could get along with Russia, wouldn't that be a good thing, not a bad thing?\" Donald Trump suggested on the campaign trail. He has also hinted he would consider recognising Crimea as part of Russia, he has criticised Nato and suggested lifting sanctions against Russia. So, how unusual is it for a US presidential candidate to be so pro-Moscow? \"It's never happened - it never happened in the last 70 years or so,\" believes Michael McFaul, a former US ambassador to Moscow, currently director and senior fellow at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies at Stanford University. \"Trump says things about Russia, about Putin personally, that are way beyond convention for a Democrat or Republican candidate, or for a politician in either party.\" But why? Is Donald Trump, as some of his critics claim, a Putin plant? A Russian agent? That may be giving President Vladimir Putin rather too much credit. He is powerful but perhaps not so powerful that he can fix a US election. Still, there is a suspicion that a recent cyber attack on the Democratic Party and the subsequent leak of embarrassing emails were a Russian operation. \"I think we know pretty definitively that Russian organisations hacked those emails and were on those systems,\" concludes Michael McFaul. \"Our intelligence folks have said that and senior people have said that off the record. Second, we know that WikiLeaks dumped those emails to purposely influence the course of the Democratic Convention and damage Secretary Clinton as a candidate. \"What we don't know definitively: did the Russians give the emails to WikiLeaks or did they obtain them through a different source? I fear we'll never know that. The Russians could have made that transfer without WikiLeaks ever knowing it was them. But, of course, if it were true - and the circumstantial evidence is pretty strong - that's a very direct attempt to influence the course of the elections in America.\" Moscow denies scheming in US politics. \"We're not involved. We're not supporting Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton or others in any sort of domestic elections,\" says Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova. \"It's not our business. It's up to the American people to decide. I think it's a very clear, honest and respectful position.\" And those hacking allegations? \"It was people from the Democratic Party who accused Russia of doing this,\" Ms Zakharova tells me. \"Don't you think it's part of the game? We're treating this as part of the game. Their game: the domestic US political game.\" And yet, with Hillary Clinton adopting a hard line on Moscow, and Donald Trump praising President Putin, is the Kremlin really sitting on the fence? \"Obviously, Russia would prefer Trump,\" says Fyodor Lukyanov, editor-in-chief of Russia in Global Affairs. \"It's quite understandable that Russia would prefer the candidate who is making statements. I wouldn't call them pro-Russian, but they correspond pretty well to the Russian picture of how the world should be. \"Personalities who reject dogmas of political correctness - like the former Italian premier Silvio Berlusconi - have enjoyed a much better understanding with Putin than those who stick to political correctness. In this regard, psychologically, I can imagine Putin and Trump understand each other.\" Back at the pop concert, the Russian Michael Jackson cannot see what all the fuss is about. \"I think it's good that Donald Trump loves Russia so much,\" Philipp Kirkorov tells me.

{"article": "It declared a major incident because the back log of patients was so high. But what is worrying was that this was no major trauma. There had been no major car accident or fire; there was no flu epidemic or winter vomiting bug. All of this happened against a relatively quiet backdrop. So why? There is no real explanation for the huge surge in patients and the \"chaotic\" scenes that followed. The Royal Victoria Hospital is Northern Ireland's regional trauma centre housing its biggest accident and emergency unit. It has an international reputation for its pioneering work dealing with the victims of 30 years of Northern Ireland's Troubles. However, it is understood that problems had been simmering since last weekend when patients had been diverted from other hospitals to the RVH. By Wednesday, the RVH was still not back on its feet and it had to start diverting ambulances to other hospitals. But how did Wednesday's crisis happen? The lack of middle-grade doctors across the United Kingdom is partly to blame. There is a 50% shortage affecting emergency departments nationwide. The lack of medical staff is a real problem that is being felt across Northern Ireland. It has also been suggested that the majority of medical students are women. Five to seven years down their career paths, they may marry and have children. Given the hours and the stress, some of them may not choose a career in the emergency department and may decide to leave. Men, too, want a work/life balance and it is difficult to recruit them to a career in an emergency department. Staff burn-out in A&E is another issue. In November 2012, almost all of the emergency medicine consultants in the Belfast Health Trust raised concerns about the safety of A&E. The clinical director of the RVH at that time, Dr Russell McLaughlin, also decided to step aside. It is understood he felt strongly about the running of the A&E. Another problem for emergency departments is the four-hour target for patient waiting times.  There is tremendous pressure on staff and on individual health trusts to tick that four-hour box. What must also be addressed is the provision of minor injuries units and out-of-hours services that the community feels confident about. What role are GPs playing to support that and to prevent Accident and Emergency being used for anything other than genuine accidents and real emergencies? Questions about what happened at the RVH on Wednesday night must now be put to the trust, senior managers, the health and social care board and its chief executive John Compton.

But he said British firms need to raise their game when it came to selling their goods and services abroad. Mr Fox was criticised last month for suggesting that British companies had become \"fat and complacent\". Mr Fox, a key Leave campaigner who was brought back into government by Prime Minister Theresa May, is hoping to set up trade agreements after the UK leaves the EU. In his speech to Tory activists, Mr Fox said free trade was \"the building block of who we are\" as a country and the UK had a \"tremendous opportunity to shape the world for the benefit of all\" in the wake of the vote to leave the EU. Suggesting that the UK had \"outsourced\" trade policy when it joined the EU Common Market in 1973, he said Brexit would bring it back \"to the heart\" of government. While there were huge opportunities to negotiate free trade deals after Brexit, Mr Fox said the UK and other \"passionate champions of free trade\" had to \"drown out\" the voices of protectionism. He also warned that the UK's trade balance had deteriorated since 2011, compared with countries such as the US and France - with exports accounting for 27% of the UK's GDP, compared with levels of more than 45% elsewhere. The international trade secretary said just 11% of British firms traded overseas and that \"we know from the performance of the best that we can do much better overall\". He also attacked those who tried to portray the referendum result as a sign of the UK \"turning inwards\" - saying the UK would \"harness all our natural advantages as we seek to carve a new role outside the European Union\". \"The British people presented us with a shining opportunity to make history.

{"article": "\"People are in chaos, people are leaving\" as they don't know what is going to happen, he said. The Gambia's Chief Justice has declined to rule on an application by President Yahya Jammeh to ban the inauguration of Adama Barrow as his successor. Mr Barrow won the election and an inauguration is planned for Thursday. But Mr Jammeh rejected the result and is refusing to step down until the Supreme Court hears his challenge, in May. His legal team had asked for an injunction to block Mr Barrow's inauguration. The BBC's Umaru Fofana reports from Banjul that Chief Justice Emmanuel Fagbenle said he could not rule on the issues as he is a subject of it. The motion sought to stop him from swearing in Mr Barrow. Parliament has also reconvened for an emergency session. While the reasons for the meeting are unclear, our correspondent says that parliament may be asked to extend Mr Jammeh's term of office. Mr Barrow will stay in Senegal until his inauguration, state media in Senegal say. The Gambia, a tiny country of less than two million people, is surrounded on three sides by Senegal and regional bloc Ecowas has said it is considering military intervention to force Mr Jammeh to relinquish power. One woman boarding the boat with her three children told our correspondent that the political uncertainty made it hard to ensure she could look after her children. \"We don't know what to expect with electricity outage, water shortage, food supplies,\" she said. Another said she was going \"because things are not safe\". \"I'm going because I am afraid. I'm going until we have peace and then we can come back.\" The UN refugee agency said last week that several thousand people, mainly children, have crossed into Senegal from The Gambia since 3 January. \"UNHCR teams report seeing buses filled with children, accompanied by women, cross the border,\" said Liz Ahua, the regional representative for UNHCR. Mr Jammeh's attempt to overturn the election result has been delayed because of a shortage of judges. The African Union has said it will no longer recognise Mr Jammeh's authority after his term ends.

{"article": "On the face of it, the slogan \"Girls do not need a prince\" doesn't seem that controversial. In many parts of the world, it would pass as the kind of thing any young woman might wear without prompting a second look. But when the actress, Kim Jayeon, tweeted a photograph of herself wearing the garment, she generated a storm and lost herself a job. She was the voice of one of the characters in a South Korean online game called \"Closers\". Gaming is very big in South Korea, as much a part of the culture as football. Fans of \"Closers\" inundated Nexon, the company which produced the game, with complaints. Many of the complaints, according to female activists, were offensive and anti-women. Nexon quickly bowed to the protesters and sacked the actress.  It told the BBC that she would be paid in full for her work but her voice would not be used on the game. It issued a statement saying it had \"recognised the voices of concern amongst the Closers community\", adding that \"we have suddenly decided to seek a replacement in the role\". The company later told the BBC it had decided not to use the actress's voice because it didn't approve of the T-shirt and why it was being sold. The problem was that the slogan is associated with a feminist group in South Korea called Megalia, which campaigns against the misogyny which its (usually anonymous) members say pervades Korean life. The T-shirt was being sold by Megalia to finance lawsuits brought by women against men they alleged had ill-treated them. There's no doubt Megalia is controversial and confrontational.  Its logo includes an image of a hand with a first finger and thumb close together - the common sign for smallness. The logo is taken by some men and Megalians as a derogatory and deliberately provocative reference to the size of Korean penises. Many men do not like Megalia.  Some retaliate with online abuse - with \"bitches\" being one of the mildest words used. It was in this toxic atmosphere that the actress tweeted the T-shirt. with its slogan \"Girls do not need a prince\". She is not giving interviews and it's not known if she wore the shirt in the tweet without being aware of the context. Megalians say the slogan was meant to decry a male idea that women need men to protect and support them. They argue that what Korean women really need is respect and equality - things they say are in short supply. One Megalia activist involved, Alex Song, told the BBC that a demonstration was organised against the sacking of the actress. A protest initially of 100 women quickly grew to 300. But some men held a counter-demonstration.  She said she felt heavily intimidated.  Some men took pictures of the protesters.  Some feminists were called \"pigs\". South Korean feminists say it illustrates a wider problem. South Korea is a very traditional society which is changing rapidly.  It has moved from a dirt poor, agricultural country to one of the world's most prosperous industrial societies in a few decades, a process which took Europe more than a century. Hence, there are contradictions:  South Korean women are highly groomed and made-up.  They meet conventional male expectations.  Plastic surgery is routine. Old attitudes and expectations clash with new ones. And as they clash, there is anger. A blogger who writes under the pseudonym Emily Singh told the BBC she had taken her picture down from her own blog because she feared reprisals. She said that many Korean women were in such despair that they considered emigrating. One Megalian said she had direct experience of a recruitment company insisting that a translator for a conference be pretty.  The recruiter had insisted on a full-body photograph, with weight and dimensions detailed. In another incident, a Korean version of Maxim magazine featured a staged picture on the cover of a man smoking coolly, leaning against his flash car with a lifeless woman, her heels bound, in the boot behind him like a victim of sexual crime. Earlier this year, a woman was murdered in a random attack in a public toilet. The male attacker had been lying in wait in the toilet, waiting for a woman to come along. After the murder, feminists demonstrated at the scene against anti-female violence - but some men also counter-demonstrated. Within the feminist movement, there is debate - often fierce debate - about tactics. Megalia is radical but even within its ranks there is a feeling that it may go too far, over, for example, whether to out gay men who marry women as a cover for their homosexuality. On other matters, there is less disagreement.  South Korean feminist groups are unanimous in criticising the entertainment industry for what they say is the over-sexualisation of young girls (lolitafication), particularly in K-Pop groups. Megalia is one of the feminist groups confronting what its members say is hypocrisy. For example, the group highlights, very publicly, the practice of some Korean men having affairs with prostitutes while on business trips abroad. This controversy is given added zing in the online gaming industry which, in many parts of the world, has been accused of being dominated by males who sometimes seem anti-women. In the United States, there have been allegations that gaming is played sometimes by men who exhibit a deep and aggressive sexism. That sexism, Megalia activist Alex Song says, feeds off images of \"sexually exaggerated\" women on screen. The thought that one of the characters in the Korean game \"Closers\" should be voiced (out-of-vision) by someone who might wear a T-shirt with a feminist slogan was just too much for some. The company agreed. The actress' voice will not be heard in the game. In the real world, though, silencing feminist voices is harder.

{"article": "Bright spots within a 90km-wide crater have baffled scientists since the probe spied them on its approach. Now in orbit around Ceres, Dawn is gathering detailed data about the world's geology and its composition. Mission researchers described the latest images at the European Planetary Science Congress in Nantes, France. Currently, their best guess to account for the spots is an expanse of some type of salt - but this is speculation. \"We haven't solved the source of the white material,\" said the mission's principal investigator Chris Russell from the University of California Los Angeles. \"We think that it's salt that has somehow made its way to the surface. We're measuring the contours, trying to understand what the surface variations in that crater are telling us.\" Ceres is a 950km-wide dwarf planet sitting in the Solar System's asteroid belt. Dawn is currently orbiting it at a distance of 1,470km and imaging the entire surface every 11 days. It was eight years ago this week that Dawn blasted off on its mission from Cape Canaveral, Florida. Before arriving at Ceres six months ago, the spacecraft dropped in on the asteroid Vesta for just over a year in 2011 and 2012. The latest release of data includes a new topographic map, showing the shape of Ceres' entire surface in the most detail yet. \"The irregular shapes of craters on Ceres are especially interesting, resembling craters we see on Saturn's icy moon Rhea,\" said deputy mission chief Carol Raymond from Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. \"They are very different from the bowl-shaped craters on Vesta.\" There is also a colour-enhanced mosaic image that offers clues about what the dwarf planet is made of - arguably asking more questions than it answers. \"There's an interesting blue ring here,\" Prof Russell told a media briefing at the conference. \"We have absolutely no idea what that blue ring is due to. \"And there are streaks across the surface that point back to the Occator Crater with its bright spots. We are poking at this, and we're looking for ideas, but we haven't solved the problem yet.\" An oddly shaped mountain that towers 6km above relatively flat surrounding terrain is also puzzling the team, Prof Russell added, because it does not look like the result of known geological processes. \"We're having difficulty understanding what made that mountain,\" he told reporters. In October, Dawn will start dropping to its final target altitude of 375km for an even closer look at Ceres. This will be its final home. Even after it ceases operations in mid-to-late 2016, the probe is expected to stay in this stable orbit and become a permanent fixture in the dwarf world's sky. \"We're not going to leave Ceres.

{"article": "Berlin had been genuinely shocked when David Cameron and senior Conservatives had spoken of imposing \"emergency brakes\", \"caps\" or quotas on the numbers of EU migrants moving to Britain. Such restrictions would have completely undermined the principle of freedom of movement in the German view. Angela Merkel feared that British plans contained risks for the European project and she was determined to stop them. Two weeks ago the former Prime Minister Sir John Major came to Berlin to make a speech about Britain and Europe. In it he said: \"I do recognise - reluctantly - that our small island simply cannot absorb the present and projected numbers at the current speed: it is not physically or politically possible without huge public disquiet.\" Afterwards during questions, Sir John underlined his point by saying that at the very heart of the problem was \"numbers, numbers, numbers\". Listening to him was one of Angela Merkel's closest aides. Over dinner he explained the German red line - they would reject any plan that was seen to weaken freedom of movement. The Chancellery wanted that message passed to Downing Street. So began a search for a policy which might dissuade some EU migrants from coming to Britain without impinging on their right to move anywhere in the EU. Downing Street believed the key lay in reducing incentives to move to the UK. The answer, in their view, lay in restricting benefits for those who had recently begun working in the UK. For the first four years they would be unable to receive tax credits or child benefits, or be considered for social housing. Without such benefits, it was argued, some migrants might be deterred from coming to the UK because the money they earned would not be much greater than back in their home country. The German chancellor was briefed in detail by David Cameron yesterday. Her response is said to have been \"warm\". The Cameron plan involved \"rule changes\" certainly, but it did not challenge the core principles of the EU as contained in the treaties. In the writing of the plan there had been wide consultation between London and Berlin. One official said you could \"see the German influence\" on the speech. The German Chancellery later on Friday put out a statement pointing out that David Cameron \"has acknowledged in his speech\"  the importance of free movement as a central pillar of the European Union and the Common Market. The German government \"is prepared to work closely with Great Britain....to address all the problems\". The British saw this as a positive reaction. Some allies of Angela Merkel, however, were expressing concern at EU migrants being denied benefits received by others for a period of four years. One German MP said he felt it was discriminatory and there were bound to be legal challenges. Downing Street, too, expects legal problems, which is why today David Cameron said \"these changes, taken together, will require some treaty changes\". The idea of treaty change divides the German establishment. One MP said to me today: \"Re-negotiating the treaties is an illusion.\" But others like German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schauble believe treaty change will be necessary to enforce discipline within the eurozone. In the end there are degrees of treaty change. It should also be pointed out that many German MPs share some of the British concerns. This year Germany has taken in nearly 400,000 migrants and refugees, more than any other EU country. Already the mayors of 24 towns have expressed concern at the pressures on local resources in dealing with migrants. So some German MPs agree that there needs to be some flexibility in interpreting freedom of movement. There was today a frequently asked question among politicians in Berlin. Is this the centre-piece of any future British re-negotiation? If Germany backs a compromise, would that be enough for David Cameron to say to the British people that he had won a major concession or would there be a long list of further requests?

{"article": "The Perseid meteor shower appears in our skies every August and peaked overnight. For once the weather played ball, with clouds clearing at just the right time. That led to a spectacular show for those prepared to stay out to the early hours of the morning. \"I thought it was great because in previous years we've had moonlight or we've had totally overcast skies. So for me it was one of the best ones,\" Prof Mark Bailey of Armagh Observatory said. \"For me it really demonstrated two things - firstly the importance of going for it at the time of the maximum of the shower, because then you see two or three times more meteors than you would a day or two before or a day or two after and then choosing the year when the moon is well out of the way. \"So take those two things together and then the only thing is the weather and as it happened it cleared overnight.\" The Perseids are pieces of Comet Swift-Tuttle; each August, the Earth passes through a cloud of the comet's debris. The display was widely anticipated this year as the shower coincided with a new moon for the first time since 2007, creating a darkened sky. \"By the time I got to my home in the country it was very dark and clear and within about 10 or 15 minutes I saw another four or five fairly bright meteors,\" Prof Bailey said. \"So that was actually rather good - the shower had developed more or less as expected. Four or five meteors in 10 or 15 minutes - bright ones - is quite good going. \"That suggests it was the peak of the shower by about half past one in the morning.\" He said a group of about 35 people including some children visited Armagh Observatory on Wednesday night to view the meteors. \"They loved it, they all enjoyed it. It had been so frustrating to see this low, thin cloud practically blocking everything out,\" Prof Bailey said. \"So, in a way, everyone was prepared to be disappointed and then right at the end, just before the time they would have had to leave, we decided to have one more look because we could see the skies were beginning to clear. \"They stayed for another half an hour until everybody had seen a meteor.\" And what of that strangely co-operative weather? \"Clouds cleared across much of NI at some stage last night and as a result a lot of people were treated to an amazing display of meteor showers,\" BBC weather presenter Cecila Daly said. \"The International Space Station was also visible late on Wednesday evening and in some places the Aurora was on view.

{"article": "A Futurelearn online course will provide credits towards a University of Leeds undergraduate degree. It will mean reducing the time and cost of tuition fees for a full degree. Futurelearn chairman Peter Horrocks says this will provide the flexibility needed by many students. The online learning platform, which offers courses from more than 50 universities, was set up in 2013 by the Open University, as a UK provider for so-called Moocs (massive, open, online courses). There are 3.7 million students registered for Futurelearn's online courses, but Mr Horrocks says that this latest development represents a \"really significant step\". It will allow students to take a University of Leeds online course in Environmental Challenges and, if they pass an exam, to gain credits towards a geography degree at Leeds. Students wanting to take an exam and gain credits this way will have to pay Â£545, but it will lead to a discount of Â£750 on tuition fees for a full degree. The course will be taught from September and will represent 10 credits, with a full year being 120 credits. Mr Horrocks, who is the Open University's vice chancellor, says this is an important move towards a more flexible degree system, making university courses more \"cost effective and time effective\". He says it provides an answer to the government's recent White Paper on higher education, which called for more flexible and competitive ways of delivering degree courses. The partnership with Leeds is expected to be followed by a number of other universities. Mr Horrocks says that it creates an alternative path with \"real quality and credibility\" which could help more part-time students to improve their qualifications. The traditional three-year, residential university system would not disappear, he said, but for many people that remained \"too conventional, too inflexible, too locked down\". But he said that cost remained a barrier to part-time learning. In England, he said, there is \"still a fall out from the tuition fees increase\". Universities should see online learning as a way to extend the reach of their research and scholarship. \"A digital platform is the purest form of an ideas marketplace. If you've got the greatest ideas, why wouldn't you want to be on an open platform where your learning can create great social, cultural and economic benefits?\" Simon Nelson, Futurelearn's chief executive, says the technology and quality of online learning has been rapidly improving and that the impact of digital technology on education was accelerating. \"Universities are looking at a world that is going more digital, more quickly than they are comfortable with - and they are having to think about their digital strategy,\" said Mr Nelson. Neil Morris, director of digital learning at the University of Leeds, said this was a step towards a more \"pick and mix\" style of higher education, in which students could have a much more customised approach to learning. Prof Morris said that it could lead to students putting together their own degree courses, studying different units from different universities and mixing online learning with residential courses.", "question": "A UK online university @placeholder is claiming a \" breakthrough moment \" with a project which will allow students to cut the cost of a Russell Group degree by studying part of it online .", "option_0": "network", "option_1": "group", "option_2": "college", "option_3": "project", "option_4": "trusts", "label": 0}

But he's not alone down there - the coffin has been specially adapted so he can broadcast live on social media. His aim is to reach out to those in despair. Mr Edwards, 61, is former drug addict and alcoholic who has been sober for more than two decades. After experiencing what he described as an \"incredible encounter with God 27 years ago\", he set up a number of Christian rehabilitation centre and homeless shelters. Having lost more than 20 of his friends to addiction and suicide, Mr Edwards now counsels and prays with people in distress or despair. For the next three days, his message of \"hope\" is coming from beyond the grave in the grounds of Willowfield church in east Belfast. He has been taking calls, texts and emails from members of the public who are seeking help. \"My plan is to speak to them from the grave before they get there and show them hope,\" he told the Belfast Telegraph.

{"article": "The film, made by Crazy Heart director Scott Cooper, features an all-star cast including Benedict Cumberbatch, Joel Edgerton, Dakota Johnson and Kevin Bacon but it's Depp who is a frontrunner for the upcoming awards season as critics, including industry magazine Variety, hail his interpretation of Bulger as a \"career-best work\". The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw adds that the actor is \"horribly watchable\" as the Boston crime boss, who was jailed for life in 2013 for the murders of 19 people. Depp says he took on the role of Bulger simply \"for the joy of the part, I was fascinated by him for years. He ended up on the FBI's Most Wanted list after informing for them. How did he evade justice for so long? \"You do things for the fans too, though I don't like that word,\" he continues. \"I like to call them my bosses, because they're the ones who employ me. So you turn up to work for them.\" Based on the book published in 2001, Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance between the FBI and the Irish Mob, the film details one of the greatest scandals in FBI history: that from 1975 the bureau largely ignored the crimes of Bulger and his associates in return for informing on a rival mob in Boston. When the cover-up was made public in 1994, Bulger went on the run for more than 16 years. He was eventually caught and tried, at the age of 82. Depp says his challenge was to find \"the essential humanity of the man - not to play him like a bad guy or a killer. It would have been too easy but that wasn't the way. He was still a human being who loved his mother, and his brother, and who took care of the people who lived around him. \"I think violence was his business and he didn't understand anything else. I call it the light switch going on and off - that he could make those violent decisions and then just carry on with his family.\" The actor absorbed the few video and audio recordings that exist of Bulger, but reveals he did ask Bulger, now an 86-year-old inmate of a Florida jail, if they could meet. \"I did ask Mr Bulger if he would grant me some time, but he respectfully declined. Those were the exact words he used and I understood that very well. It was a very long shot anyway, because the idea of some guy playing him in a film was just weird. \"He was very gentlemanly about it - he just said he didn't like the book about him, and I can understand that he wouldn't be much of a fan.\" Depp's trademark over a 30-year career has been to transform himself physically for his roles, including for Edward Scissorhands, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Alice in Wonderland, Sweeney Todd and Jack Sparrow in Pirates of the Caribbean. The last two roles earned him two of his Oscar nominations, but director Cooper says his star has beaten his past form and his resemblance to the real Bulger is \"uncanny\", thanks to prosthetics used to recreate the mobster's unusually light skin and eyes. Cooper recalls that Bulger's attorney was on set one day and \"was spooked by Johnny's appearance\". \"The lawyer said that the way Johnny looked, moved, and sounded - that it was Whitey Bulger.\" \"The physicality of the man was hugely important,\" Depp confirms. \"I beefed up for it because he was a tough guy. I have some brilliant make-up artists who worked with me on Pirates of the Caribbean and we devised the look several times until one day I looked in the mirror and saw him. \"I had some letters from Mr Bulger's former associates saying I'd freaked them out. It's good to hear it.\" Depp calls Cumberbatch, who plays Bulger's brother Billy, a Massachusetts Senator, \"a beautiful man of exceptional talent. He became like a real life brother\". \"The set-up we were playing was an unusual one - one brother becomes a politician, the other is king of the underworld. They still meet up for family dinners and church, just from opposing sides. It takes an actor with a lot of ability, like Benedict, to make that credible.\" Cooper adds that while he expected Depp's fans to be showing up on filming locations, that instead it was Cumberbatch's followers \"that were unlike anything I have ever seen in my life before\". \"They were on every street corner. I don't think Benedict can understand it either.\" At this year's Toronto Film Festival, Depp issued a tongue-in-cheek thank-you to Cooper \"for reviving my career\".  The actor has had some critical and box office flops recently, most notably The Lone Ranger and Mortdecai. On the subject of Oscars, last month Depp told BBC Radio 1's Newsbeat that he \"didn't want to win one of those things ever,\" adding, \"I don't want to have to talk. A nomination is plenty. I'm not in competition with anybody\". Previously he has said of his film choices: \"I just stick to my guns and do what I want to do - sometimes people don't like it and that's alright.\" But Cooper says: \"Johnny is thrilled with the reaction (to Black Mass) and can't wait for people to see the film. He takes risks that most movie stars will not. \"He has had a career that is enviable by any actor's standards but he has privately said thank-you to me for the movie.

Keane told Eir Sport: \"It was very tough - it was an emotional night for me. \"I just want to thank everyone who came along to support me and tell them that I've enjoyed every minute of my 18 years with the team. \"Everyone wanted me to score and I'm delighted to finish off in this way. \"I look forward to now sitting back and watching the team as a fan.\" Keane's goal tally leaves him joint fourth with Muller as Europe's best marksman in international football and behind Ferenc Puskas, Sandor Kocsis and Miroslav Klose.

The 18-year-old, who attended the proceedings, was one of three teenagers jailed for the murder of Garry Newlove. He was told that no arguable grounds had been raised which could affect the safety of the verdict. Mr Newlove, a 47-year-old salesman who had overcome stomach cancer, was beaten to death after confronting vandals outside his home in 2007. He suffered massive head injuries in the attack, which was witnessed by his daughters, and died two days later in hospital. Cunliffe, formerly of Warrington, was found guilty of murder by a jury at Chester Crown Court in January 2008. He was 16 at the time of conviction and is serving a minimum term of 12 years. Mr Newlove had left his home to remonstrate with the teenagers about vandalism to vehicles where he lived when he was set upon. Ringleader Adam Swellings, of Crewe, Cheshire, lost an appeal in November 2008 against his conviction and his 17-year sentence.

Tears as a soldier from Iraq's Mosul finds his mum on a bus Close encounter with the moon The tricks on Trump Joe Biden might be planning - in memes In March this year, as Indiana governor, Mr Pence signed an anti-abortion bill that is seen as one of the most restrictive in the US, barring abortion in Indiana on the basis of disability, gender or race of the foetus. Parts of that law were blocked by the courts, but not until after a social media backlash which saw women phoning or tweeting Mr Pence details about their menstrual cycles under the hash tag #periodsforpence. There had already been a significant rise in gifts to the country's biggest abortion provider in the wake of Mr Trump's election last week. But then over the weekend, many women went on social media to say they had made a donation in Mike Pence's name.

What Donald Trump is planning on abortion 'Hello governor, I have my period' Planned Parenthood hasn't commented in detail on the post-election trend of donating in Mr Pence's honour.

{"article": "We spend billions sending craft and people into space, but we do not really know what happens under the waves. One man who finds that more than curious is Graham Hawkes, a beneath-the-sea maverick who has been working on underwater craft for most of his life. It is a lonely, driven quest, relying rather dangerously on the engagement and backing of a few wealthy enthusiasts. Born in London, Mr Hawkes learnt his engineering expertise in the defence industry, working initially on torpedoes in Norfolk, England. In the 1980s he went to the US, working on oil and gas exploration before setting up on his own, with the aim of bringing a new clarity and purpose to manned exploration of the deep ocean. In his harbourside workshop just across the Bay from San Francisco, Mr Hawkes shows me some of the results of his years of work: submersible craft looking much more like planes than conventional submarines. There are various versions, all called DeepFlight. One of those I look at has a 12-foot (4 metre) wingspan. It is beautiful, quiet and light enough to load and unload from relatively small support vessels. It is designed to explore the deepest part of the sea, the Mariana Trench in the Western Pacific somewhere between Japan and Papua New Guinea. The Trench is much deeper than Mount Everest is high - almost 7,000 feet (2,100m) deeper. The water pressure down there is a thousand times the atmospheric pressure at sea level. That is where Mr Hawkes wants his underwater flying machine to go. So did the late Steve Fossett, the American multimillionaire adventurer with 115 world records or world firsts to his name. He died in an air crash in the Californian mountains in 2008, just as Mr Hawkes was within four weeks of putting the DeepFlight Challenger through its first tests. It was being built for Mr Fossett to claim another record - the first solo exploration of the Mariana Trench. The US Navy two-man bathyscaphe, The Trieste, got to the bottom of the Trench in 1960. Two unmanned vessels have since been down there, but a one-man flying machine would be a very different proposition. Steve Fossett's untimely death was a big blow to Mr Hawkes and the DeepFlight team. Now they need another multimillionaire with similar ambitions to take on the challenge. The submersibles are beautiful machines, breathtakingly simple to operate. They treat water like air, says Mr Hawkes. From early on, he has had the reputation of making things happen. But being a deep sea pioneer is not easy. And if we are properly to survey the two-thirds of the world that is scarcely known to us, clever robots will do most of the work down at the ocean bottom. It is much safer, and cheaper, than sending humans. And there may be great mineral and other riches to be found, to say nothing of a host of unknown life forms. But submarines and bathyspheres and robots do not catch the imagination in the way that DeepFlight does. For one thing, they do not fly.", "question": "Two - thirds of the @placeholder is underwater .

{"article": "If you're in the market for a fighter jet, passenger plane, satellite, or drone, the biennial show - the 51st since 1909 - is the place to be. There'll be plenty to choose from. As with previous shows, the news flow will be dominated by the big beasts of aerospace, Airbus and Boeing. Planemakers like, if possible, to time their multi-billion-dollar orders to coincide with air shows. But such stage-management tends to be a decision for the customers, not the suppliers. There has, though, been an uncharacteristic lack of pre-show hype this time. Cowen & Co analyst Cai von Rumohr says the combined Boeing and Airbus order tally for civil aircraft by the end of the week could be below the average 387 seen in the past few years. It's possible that airlines are pausing for breath. A rush to buy aircraft after the financial crisis means that Airbus and Boeing have record backlogs of almost 12,000 aircraft. Delivery slots for new planes are years in the future. Boeing published its closely watched annual market forecast on Thursday, and expects airlines and freight firms to take delivery of 38,050 aircraft worth $5.6 trillion (Â£3.6tn) by 2034. Two out of every five newly built aircraft will feed Asia's booming travel market, Boeing said. So, if Paris produces fewer orders than usual, it's a blip not a trend. It being a French air show, Airbus products will feature prominently. The centrepiece will be the long-range A350, which will fly displays daily. Expect Airbus to unveil orders for the aircraft, and its short-to-medium range products. But what it really wants is more sales of the A380 super-jumbo. There have been just 317 sales since its launch 10 years ago, and questions have been asked about its future. A big theme of this year's event is the environment. The schedule of press conferences and briefings include a lot about innovations to do with efficiency, rather than building the big new products of the future. Top industry officials, government ministers and environmental experts will be there to discuss air travel's impact on climate change. Attendees will include Nobel peace prize co-laureate Philippe Ciais, of France's Climate and Environmental Sciences Laboratory, and France's Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius. On the \"green\" theme, Airbus will be flying its E-Fan 2.0 electric prototype, which can achieve a speed of 136mph and fly for about an hour. Weighing less than half a ton, the aircraft has lithium-ion polymer batteries in its 31ft wings. A final assembly line is being built in south west France, and the plan is for an all-electric two-seater to enter service around the end of 2017 or early 2018. Air shows can sometimes look like corporate virility symbols, a chance to outdo rivals. And Qatar Airways has opted to underline its huge success in recent years by bringing five aircraft to Paris, including an A380 and a Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Below the Airbus-Boeing duopoly are smaller planemakers, such Bombardier, Embraer, ATR and Sukhoi Civil Aircraft. Shows are important for them, as they get fewer opportunities to present their products to such a global audience. Bombardier, which debuts two variants of its C-Series aircraft, needs orders. Shareholders are uneasy about the C-Series investment, and hoped Paris would be a turning point. Yet, last week, Bombardier seemed to be playing down the likelihood of big deals. New chief executive Alain Bellemare, speaking at an aviation meeting in Miami, said: \"Paris, to be honest with you, it's one milestone, but it's not that critical. It's a few days in a year. It's a few days in the life of a 20-25-year programme.\" Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at Teal Group, said the old Bombardier management was \"in complete denial\" about the C-Series' problems. He expects the new management to take a more aggressive approach to sales, offering more deals and incentives. On the military side, the return of the US, the world's biggest defence customer by far, is being seen as a coup. The US military and diplomatic presence was largely absent in 2013 because of the sequestration budget crisis. The official US presence may be discreet, however, following a warning by the US State Department. According to a report in the Washington Times the Department has told private companies and delegates to be on guard for economic espionage and terrorism. \"Transnational terrorist groups affiliated with al-Qaeda have a presence in Paris and elsewhere in France, and continue to pose a threat to American interests,\" the State Department said. No US aircraft will be taking part in the 20-plus daily flying displays, although there will be aircraft on static display. And although some big US contractors, including Northrop Grumman, will not be attending, the US will still have about 220 exhibitors in Paris, which is second only to France. Amongst the multi-billion-dollar US hardware on show, it's a cut-price fighter jet that may receive a lot of attention. The Scorpion, made by Textron AirLand, part of the group behind Bell Helicopters and Cessna Aircraft, uses off-the-shelf parts to keep costs down. It has yet to receive an order, though. Another \"affordable\" combat aircraft likely to be received with a mixture of interest and curiosity is the JF-17 Thunder, a joint project between China's Chengdu and Pakistan Aeronautical Complex. It, too, has no export orders, although there is speculation that Bulgaria may do a deal. France, bolstered by April's $7bn order from Qatar for Rafale fighters, will have a big military presence. This includes two variants of Dassault's Rafale jets, and Eurocopter's Tiger attack helicopter. Arguably the most important display will be the Airbus A400M military transport aircraft. Plagued by delays and costly overruns, the â‚¬28bn (Â£20bn; $31bn) project suffered a major setback in May when an aircraft crashed in Spain, killing four crew. The assumption was that the A400M would be grounded for the show. But Airbus said last Wednesday that it would perform displays every day this week. Most of the time, Le Bourget Airport is a drab, tired-looking place, home to an aerospace museum and a few business jets. Then the air show rolls in. So what's it actually like? For starters, you can barely move for VIPs. Chief executives and statesmen are out in force. The US contingent is considered low-key this year - yet it still includes the Air Force Secretary and a clutch of senators. The Alphas, of course, always come with their entourages - legions of PRs, minders, fixers and hangers-on. This invariably leads to a degree of one-upmanship, particularly in the rows of luxury \"chalets\", where the major players wine and dine their clients. Boeing always has a spectacular building in a prime spot next to the runway. But it's usually dwarfed by home favourite Airbus's colossal base for the week, often with a giant A380 superjumbo conveniently parked outside the door. Air show fashion is always entertaining. Dark suits and dark glasses dominate, especially among arms industry executives. Some delegations, notably those from minor powers, favour full military dress with acres of medals and gold braid. Whatever you're wearing, though, the chances are it won't be appropriate for the conditions. The summer weather in Paris is highly unpredictable. The last show was marked by torrential downpours. And I remember one year, it was so windy, people were hanging on to light aircraft on a static display to prevent them blowing over. And what of the air displays, that breathtaking parade of super-sophisticated machinery engaged in aerobatics that seem to defy the laws of physics? Well, it's fine to watch over lunch, but for many of us, frankly, it's an inconvenience. When you're trying to work, or hold important meetings, it's just too darned noisy.", "question": "It has a reputation for disorganisation , maddening congestion , and being @placeholder by monsoon - like downpours .

{"article": "They talked about what had attracted them to London and \"how we can continue to build on that for the future,\" Mrs May told the BBC's economics editor Kamal Ahmed, in Davos. Her remarks came as several big banks said they may move staff out of London. Both HSBC and UBS have said they could relocate about 1,000 jobs. Mrs May was asked if she was disappointed that it was becoming clear that there was a price to Brexit. \"I want to negotiate a free trade agreement with the European Union which will give us the maximum access, the right deal for Britain, maximum access to the single European market for trading with and operating within that market for both goods and services,\" she said. \"I think that's not just in the interests of the UK, I think that's in the interests of the European Union as well,\" she added. May: UK will lead world on free trade Bank exodus? What did Davos make of May's speech? Mrs May said she had had a \"very good positive discussion with banks about the benefits of the City of London, about what it is that has brought them to the City of London and how we can continue to build on that for the future\". There were \"huge benefits\" for investment in the UK, Mrs May added, which she said had a \"fundamentally very strong economy\". She said the service sector was very important to the UK and that she believed that \"truly global Britain can bring jobs and prosperity to the UK across the board, including in financial services\". Mrs May was asked if the government might be prepared to give preferential treatment to EU immigrants coming to the UK in exchange for privileged access to the single market. People who voted for Brexit were voting for \"us to take control of our immigration laws for people coming from the EU into the UK\", she said. \"We're looking at the various systems that are possible at the moment. The key issue for people in the UK is that we have control, that's it's the government that is deciding our immigration rules,\" she added. Earlier, Mrs May told leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos that the UK will be a \"world leader\" on trade. But the prime minister also warned that inequality blamed on globalisation was aiding the \"politics of division\". Her speech to business leaders and politicians in Switzerland came after EU leaders said a post-Brexit trade deal with the UK would be \"difficult\". The prime minister promised that the UK after Brexit would take on a \"leadership role as the strongest and most forceful advocate for free markets and free trade anywhere in the world\". She argued for reforms so the global economy created wealth for all, rather than a \"privileged few\", and \"centre-ground mainstream politics\" could \"work for everyone\". Mrs May said the world was enjoying an \"unprecedented level of wealth\", but many people felt this was \"not working for them\". Global elites needed to tackle the backlash against globalisation, liberalism, and free trade because leaders who \"embrace the politics of division and despair\" were working to exploit the situation. Mrs May said: \"Talk of greater globalisation can make people fearful. For many it means their jobs outsourced and their wages undercut. It means having to sit back as they watch their communities change around them. \"And in their minds, it means watching as those who prosper seem to play by a different set of rules, while for many life remains a struggle as they get by, but don't necessarily get on.\"", "question": "Prime Minister Theresa May has had \" positive discussion \" with big banks about how they might be @placeholder to keep jobs in the City of London .", "option_0": "encouraged", "option_1": "offered", "option_2": "willing", "option_3": "linked", "option_4": "flown", "label": 0}

{"article": "Sir Ian Cheshire, the former chief executive of B&Q, Britain's largest DIY chain, called today for a review of the new National Living Wage to ensure that the costs to business are not too onerous. Although Sir Ian made it clear that he supported the increase in the minimum wage, he told me that the impact on employment rates and the wage costs of many businesses was as yet unclear. In the Budget in July, the Chancellor said that he wanted to see the minimum wage increase to £9 an hour by 2020. Sir Ian said that could see wage bills increase by up to 60% for some businesses such as hotels, restaurants and care homes. \"We actually have been calling for a real increase in the minimum wage anyway, so in that sense the direction of travel is fine and we think it's broadly a good move, particularly if it helps to continue to boost the economy,\" Sir Ian, Whitehall's leading non-executive director, told the BBC. \"It will force businesses to focus on productivity and skills which are really big issues. \"I think most businesses over time can adapt. \"The problem is always when you get given a very short period in which to make a lot of change and that's where I think we should come back in two years, have a look at how we're doing and then work out whether that trajectory still makes sense. \"I think the real challenge is in the outer years - when you start to get to £9 and that starts to be a very significant increase. \"You're talking, in some models I've seen inside businesses, of - if you go from here to 2020, wage bills going up maybe 50% or 60%. \"And that is a very big issue, particularly obviously for people in retail and hospitality.\" The increase in the minimum wage to the new \"National Living Wage\" was announced in July's Budget. George Osborne said that he wanted to see the minimum wage rise rapidly. Starting next April, for people over 24 the present minimum wage of £6.70 an hour will rise to £7.20 and then up in pretty substantial steps to £9 an hour by 2020. The announcement came as a surprise - the rate is traditionally set by the Low Pay Commission but they seem not to have been involved in this announcement. It was also of course controversial, because in that same budget Mr Osborne announced that benefits, and particularly tax credits, would be cut for those in work. Organisations such as the Institute of Fiscal Studies said that the increases would not make up for the cuts in benefits. Now, today is significant as it sees the last increase in the old minimum wage. After today, the Chancellor has to all intents and purposes taken control of the rate. Business reaction has been mixed. Some sectors like care homes, pub chains and more broadly the hospitality industry said that the increases could mean laying off staff or increasing prices. Some, though, such as Costa Coffee, Morrison's and Ikea, have seen it as an opportunity, saying that they will increase wages. Whatever the outcome, Sir Ian says that the government and the UK will only understand the impact once the new rates - starting next year - start to bed in.

Morgan Smith helped make it 18-0 while Joe Philbin crossed after the break. Joe Mellor finally got Widnes off the mark but Matty Russell continued the rout before Corey Thompson ran in a late consolation try for the visitors. The result means Warrington remain at the top of the Super League table with two games of the regular season left while Widnes remain in seventh place. It was the second time in less than a week that Warrington had taken a comfortable half-time lead, having led Catalans Dragons 18-0 the break in their 26-22 win in Perpignan on Saturday.

{"article": "But was the episode concocted to generate maximum publicity for the group's controversial views? Did a master troll take the media and politicians for a ride? Daryush \"Roosh V\" Valizadeh, the founder of Return of Kings (ROK), openly and unashamedly courts outrage. \"There is nothing the media can do anymore to hurt me, and even if they paint me as a baby murderer, I will still gain readers because of it,\" he wrote after a BBC documentary was critical of his ideas. \"As long as my name exits the mouth of my enemies, I win, and I will continue to win.\" Roosh V cancels 'Return of Kings' events By that criterion, Roosh V was well and truly a winner this week. Opposition to ROK's proposal to hold a men's \"social happy hour\" in cities around the world on Saturday started with a petition in Australia that quickly gathered thousands of signatures. Valizadeh's reaction was to announce on Twitter that he had booked a trip to Australia. A storm of media outrage followed, prompting Australia's Immigration Minister Peter Dutton to request an urgent briefing and foreshadow denying the 36-year-old American blogger a visa. \"I will sneak into your country, hold my meetings, laugh, and then slip out. Your gay authorities won't stop me,\" Valizadeh wrote in response. He baited female journalists with sexual requests and claimed he would enter Australia by boat. But he had never applied for a visa and the \"ticket\" he posted to Twitter of his planned trip was an itinerary screen grab that could be generated without booking a trip. In fact, Return of Kings' anti-feminist position is so extreme that some commentators believe it is a \"troll\" group that exists solely for the purpose of upsetting people. The site feature such headlines as \"The myth of date rape drink spiking\", \"How to turn a feminist into your sex slave\" and \"How to convince a girl to get an abortion\". The group's community beliefs state that \"a woman's value significantly depends on her fertility and beauty\", whereas \"a man's value significantly depends on his resources, intellect and character\". Return of Kings' leaders say their campaign is sincere, but they don't deny setting out to provoke strong reactions from the feminists, gay rights campaigners and their other perceived enemies. \"We write our ideas in a way that draws attention to our work and entertains our audience, because we believe our perspective has value and is worth spreading. Do not confuse provocative art with trolling,\" writes one contributor to the site. Australian cybercrime expert and former police officer Susan McLean agreed that the group's actions did not constitute trolling in the \"classic\" sense. \"Trolling usually involves groups or individuals that would concentrate on one person and hammer them online, as opposed to threatening to stick it to them at the local pub,\" Ms McLean said. \"But it certainly is a misuse of technology, [using] threats and harassment to cause upset among us here in Australia.\" Ms McLean said she believed Valizadeh's targeting of Australia was considered, given the climate of increased awareness towards abuse against women and the debate on free speech. Domestic violence and women's issues have been hot-button topics in Australia, driven by 2015 Australian of the Year Rosie Batty's advocacy on the issue. \"His views grate against those that are held by Australian civilised society and he's using that as a springboard, knowing full well he'll create a media frenzy, angst and anger,\" she said. Australia has in recent years refused to issue visas to a number of people whose views were considered out of step with community standards. Rapper Tyler the Creator and pick-up artist Julien Blanc were both refused entry to the country after campaigns accused them of promoting misogyny. Simon Breheny, director of the Legal Rights Project at the Institute of Public Affairs, said this had prompted strong debate about the limits of free speech and whether Australia's laws went too far in restricting that right. \"These cases have given the individuals concerned a very high degree of prominence in the media and so it's seen as a bit of a tactic they can use to get a lot of free exposure,\" Mr Breheny said. As outrage spread from Australia to the UK, US, Canada and elsewhere, Roosh and ROK remained defiant, attempting to move their meet-ups to private forums. \"Since this meetup was never intended as a confrontation with unattractive women and their enablers, I'm moving to save as many of these meetups as I can before Saturday,\" he wrote on the ROK website on Wednesday. In the UK, a Scottish National Party MP urged the home secretary to block Roosh from attending events in Scotland or England, although there was no indication that he was planning to do so. Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson also weighed in, tweeting that \"your pro-rape, misogynistic, homophobic garbage is not welcome\". Texas Governor Greg Abbott, Melbourne Lord Mayor Robert Doyle, Calgary Mayor Naheed Nenshi and a host of other politicians voiced similar sentiments. On Thursday Valizadeh announced he was cancelling the meet-ups because he could not \"guarantee the safety or privacy of men who want to attend\". It was a victory of sorts for ROK's opponents. But the name Roosh V is far better known than it was at the start of the week. The ROK website doubled its usual traffic to 82,000 unique users on 1 February. On Thursday, Valizadeh tweeted: \"I'm currently more popular than Jeb Bush … lol.\"  It seems likely that Valizadeh got exactly what he was looking for.", "question": "A \" neo-masculinist \" group with extreme views on women 's rights has been forced to shut down a series of proposed global meet - ups , but not before a wave of outrage fuelled by petitions , media and governments swept its @placeholder around the world .", "option_0": "message", "option_1": "activities", "option_2": "frequency", "option_3": "ranks", "option_4": "weight", "label": 0}
{"article": "As we approach the island, the first thing that stands out is the Ugandan flag on an improvised pole high above the greenery. Resident Labatin Mwiima says the flag pole acts as a reference point, by which to judge how far the 20-acre island has moved. \"You wake up in the morning and see different scenery. One evening we went to sleep at Port-bell Landing site, and we woke up in Ggaba,\" he says. The two landing sites are about 20 minutes apart by boat. While this has not been independently verified, the island is said to have been seen from at least three landing sites near the capital, Kampala. Mr Mwiima says a friend lured him to come to the island. He is a reggae musician and finds the environment relaxing and good for creativity. It is not clear whether by coincidence or design, but all 10 of the island's occupants are artists. Ali Katongole, a painter, says he was drawn to the island because of its simple lifestyle, away from the hustle and bustle of a big city like Kampala. Fittingly, it is called Mirembe, which means peace in Luganda. The residents are all men, living in grass-thatched huts. Some live there permanently, while others paddle local canoes every few days to go back to their homes in Kampala. It remains a long way from the other countries that share Lake Victoria - Tanzania and Kenya. The residents say the idea that the island might get submerged doesn't occur to them, because you cannot actually feel it moving. But Geoffrey Kamese from the Uganda Association of Professional Environmentalists, who has visited it, expresses caution. \"People should be careful and not continue farming on it, because the soil could become even weaker and sink in,\" he warns. Neat gardens of cassava, maize, beans and even bananas share space with the natural vegetation. The ground is soggy, and most of the crops are planted on mounds of soil, with ditches full of water running in between. Wild birds and chickens thrive on the bounty provided by the swamp vegetation. Mr Kamese has a theory as to how it came to be floating: There could have been water beneath the land before, and due to heavy rains, the roots of plants gave way and the patch of land floated away. \"It is possible that due to the changes happening in our weather, the amount of water in the lake increased and the soil became loose,\" he says.

{"article": "The Ferrari man is on a final warning from governing body the FIA after two 'road rage' incidents in seven months. Vettel, 30, banged wheels with Lewis Hamilton in Azerbaijan last month and swore at race director Charlie Whiting over the radio in Mexico last October. \"Sebastian wears his heart on his sleeve,\" said Red Bull boss Horner. \"He is involved in a very intense battle. He sees an opportunity to be champion again this year and he knows he's going to need everything going his way against Mercedes to achieve that. \"He has zero filter between what he thinks and what he says or does sometimes. That's the great side of him. But sometimes it gets him in hot water as well.\" Horner was Vettel's boss at Red Bull for six seasons between 2009 and 2014, and had to deal with some difficult moments in that time. Vettel and team-mate Mark Webber crashed together in Turkey in 2010, while the German refused to obey team orders in Malaysia in 2013. Horner likened Vettel's uncompromising attitude to that of his hero Michael Schumacher, whose controversial driving tactics clouded his reputation throughout his career. \"Sebastian has this huge desire within him,\" Horner said. \"The records mean a lot to him. Michael Schumacher was very much his idol and I think what you see that bubbles over sometimes is that killer instinct of, 'I want to win'. Sometimes at all costs. \"It comes across as spoilt but I think you've got to put yourself in his scenario, in his shoes. He has lifted Ferrari from where it was to where it is now and he has been a big driver in that.\" Horner said that the environment at Ferrari might be contributing to the increased number of such incidents involving Vettel. \"Ferrari are an emotional team - Latin origins - it probably fuels that emotion,\" Horner said. \"That's not to say it's a bad thing. It shows he's human at the end of the day and shows how hungry he is to achieve that ultimate goal. \"[Ferrari president Sergio] Marchionne has his own style of management. He's quite a full-on character, quite outspoken. And the demeanour of a team comes from the top. The people who lead the team set the tempo. \"You can feel Ferrari is a high-pressure place, particularly at this period of time.\" Horner said he felt Vettel could have been more severely punished for driving into Hamilton in Baku, an act motivated by the German's incorrect belief that the Mercedes driver had 'brake-tested' him. Vettel was given a 10-second stop-and-go penalty but Horner said officials could have disqualified him for the incident. \"It's a difficult one, isn't it?\" Horner said. \"That's for the stewards to judge the penalties that were available to them. On the day it could well have been [a black flag]. Other drivers in other formulas have been and there's the precedent it sets. \"But they chose the penalty they had. I think what was wrong was then to drag it on. I think it's important that everybody knows on the day what is the result, what is the punishment for that action.\" And he said that, away from the pressure of competition, Vettel was \"a great character\". \"You don't see as much of his character perhaps in his current environment,\" Horner said. \"He is a fun guy, he loves British humour, he's very good with the mechanics, the team. \"He'd turn up here with chocolates for the receptionists and girls around the factory, he was always very generous in terms of not just gifting something to the race team, but to the whole factory. He'd spend hours signing stuff and really investing into the team.\" Horner said the title battle between Vettel and Hamilton had \"a fascinating dynamic between two very different personalities and drivers\". \"Lewis is a bit more of a free spirit,\" Horner said. \"He has a huge amount of natural talent. He probably doesn't think about his talent… or his application is probably different to Sebastian. \"I have never worked with Lewis so I don't know but he relies on that natural instinct. \"He jumps in and delivers and he is a bit like an artist. You can see he has mood swings as well. \"Lewis is very out there, you know, lives the lifestyle that he does, whereas Sebastian is hugely protective and private, he almost enjoys a student-like existence.

{"article": "With polls in the UK indicating growing support for Brexit, the mood in Brussels is darkening. Attitudes are hardening among officials I speak to here. I'm often asked if the EU is preparing some \"gift\", a last-minute sweetener to beat the creeping sense of inevitability that Britain could be about to vote Leave in its referendum on the EU. Until recently, leaders of the other 27 EU members were aching for the UK to stay. But while Central and Eastern European nations are still keen to be accommodating, France has turned hardline. \"Let them go if they insist and punish them if they do,\" sums up the sentiment du jour. This has less to do with Britain, and far more to do with French domestic politics. France and Germany, the EU's biggest powers, go to the polls next year with resurgent Eurosceptic parties breathing down the necks of the political establishment. Latest updates EU referendum poll tracker Reality check: The EU referendum Should EU citizens consider becoming British? The British nationals barred from voting on their own future The penny has dropped among EU leaders that voters want less Brussels in their lives. Just today, European Council President Donald Tusk said many of the British ideas about the EU were gaining support all over Europe. But he didn't mean the Leaving idea. The Out sentiment is one Europe's leaders do not want to encourage. So a gesture pre-referendum or a quick 'n generous new deal for a post-Brexit UK seem unlikely. But would the EU really cut off its nose to spite its face? Surely outside the EU, the UK would be an attractive trading partner? \"Absolutely,\" admitted a high level Brussels source grudgingly. \"And Britain probably would get a good deal in the end but no-one here wants to hand it over easily. \"Negotiations will likely take years. And the chances of it getting messy? I'd say they were extremely high.\" The Leave campaign insists it will not sign up to a trade deal that would include having to keep the British labour market open to EU workers - the kind of arrangement Switzerland, Norway and Iceland accepted because they wanted to take part in or be close to the European single market. But, despite the fighting talk, I have also heard back-room whisperings of possibly, maybe, eventually finding some kind of accommodation for the UK, whereby it could pay a financial \"penalty\" to be part of the single market without being open to EU migration. But such scenarios are light years away from where we are now. If the British public votes Leave next Thursday, all current EU agreements would stay in place for at least two years while the UK disentangled itself from the bloc and embarked on a negotiated settlement with the EU. But this is uncharted territory and presupposes no unilateral moves from either side. \"If a post-Brexit UK government suddenly of its own accord stopped access for European workers to the British labour market for example,\" my source told me, \"EU countries would likely retaliate. A date could be chosen to simply cut Britain loose. \"If that happened, good luck.\" Rambunctious pronouncements aside, the hope in the rest of the EU remains that British voters hold their nose, accept the EU is imperfect, and decide to stay. As dark as the mood is in Brussels and beyond, it's also fervently felt in many circles that the UK referendum is a clear message that the EU must reform.

A third man, Christopher Spendlove, was cleared of manslaughter in July. The trial judge, Mr Justice Turner, told the pair, who were convicted under joint enterprise law: \"There is no such thing as a death-proof punch.\" The judge rejected any suggestion the men acted in \"excessive self-defence.\" Andrew Taylor's barrister, Lord Carlile, said the family may never know who struck the fatal blow and had the punch landed slightly to the left or right \"the consequences would have been entirely different.\" PC Doyle suffered an injury to an artery in his neck, which led to bleeding over the surface of the brain.

Meanwhile, the \"volatility index\" - a measure of investors' uncertainty - has hit levels last seen in the 2008 financial crisis. The Leave campaign argued that the pound simply retreated to March levels. The pound was down 0.2% against the dollar at $1.4226. Against the euro, sterling was down 0.6% at â‚¬1.2605 and weakened by 1% against the Japanese yen to just over 151. Investors have been spooked by data showing the chances of a Remain vote have fallen, although markets have also been rattled by global economic worries. With 10 days to go before the referendum vote, two polls at the weekend put the Leave camp ahead, while betting firm Betfair said the implied probability of a vote to Remain had now fallen to 68.5% from almost 80% a week earlier.

Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital, said the markets were now on full Brexit alert. \"Polls show it's now too close to call and markets are responding with some very twitchy activity.

The Crown told the court it believed there was no realistic prospect of conviction on a second charge. Mr Justice Sweeney formally acquitted Col Lama. The decision not to go ahead with the retrial was made because of inconsistencies in evidence, the court heard. It had been alleged Col Lama ordered the torture of two detainees held at the Nepalese Army barracks. He was arrested in January 2013 while on leave in the UK from his posting as a UN peacekeeper in South Sudan. Charges were brought under section 134 of the Criminal Justice Act, which allows suspects to face trial before a British court even if their alleged offences are committed abroad and they are not UK citizens. The original trial last year had to be abandoned because of difficulty finding Nepalese interpreters.

The giant marine reptile fossil was painstakingly removed over eight hours, shortly before another storm was due. Professional fossil hunter Paul Crossley, who helped excavate it, said it was \"a beautiful find\". \"There was a very difficult, short window before another storm blew in so we were limited for time before it got ploughed out,\" he said. With only part of the snout missing, but with most vertebrae and its rib cage in place, Mr Crossley said it was one of only a few ichthyosaur fossils found in such a complete condition on the Jurassic Coast in the past decade. Ichthyosaurs (literally 'fish-lizards') were predatory dolphin-like reptiles that swam the world's oceans 200 million years ago at the time of the dinosaurs. The fossilised remains were spotted by hobby collector Alan Saxon, from Chippenham in Wiltshire, who was on a post-Christmas visit to the Jurassic Coast. \"It was actually easy to spot - I just saw a long black snout against the grey shale. I had a closer look and could see jaws, teeth and backbones,\" he added. Mr Saxon, 59, said he was considering the best approach to ensure the fossil was conserved. \"In the long term I'd like it to be available for people to see, especially in the Lyme Regis locality,\" he said. Recent storm-force south-westerly winds hitting the crumbling cliffs have produced some of the most conducive conditions for fossil hunting on the beaches around Lyme Regis in several years. Mr Crossley said: \"The word is already out that Lyme Regis is the capital of fossil hunting at the moment, we've seen more people than normal on the beaches. \"We always advise going when the tide is falling and always stay well away from the cliffs and mudslides.

{"article": "The single-player version is about a lone individual surviving in a harsh world with only their ingenuity to keep them safe. Their very survival depends on them building a home and battling monsters employing only tools and weapons they make with their hands. If computer games were subject to the same analysis applied to novels it would be easy to read this as a metaphor for the life of Markus \"Notch\" Persson, the game's creator. He's talked in the past about growing up \"relatively poor\", about making his own entertainment, and about whether he will have to conquer the same \"demons\" that troubled his father. Family, friends and the success of the things Notch made with his hands helped him prosper in this harsh world, but that success has led to other challenges. And ones that are much harder to conquer. Just what had changed was evident at Minecon in 2012 where it was impossible for Notch to walk more than a few feet before he was grabbed by yet another fan keen to shake his hand, slap him on the back, take a photo or get him to sign their foam sword. This transformation from humble programmer responsible only for his own code to the leader of a global movement was one he was never happy with. His heartfelt explanation of why he is leaving Mojang - \"it's about my sanity\" - underscores that. He knows that Minecraft is now about overseeing a community - much, much more than it is about maintaining and developing a codebase. And therein lies the potential problem for Microsoft. With Xbox Live and its other cloud services there is no doubt that it has solid experience of running a massive computer infrastructure that serves millions of paying customers. That will be vital when it starts running the behind-the-scenes systems that keep Minecraft going. But Microsoft will alienate that community if it does not realise how personal the game is, not just for Notch, but for many of the people who play it. It's where they meet their friends and make new ones, where they express themselves, where they show off their technical and creative prowess, where they find themselves. I have seen that with my own children who play it in very different ways. One is a big fan of modified versions that involve arena battles or capture-the-flag-type competitions. The other spends hours crafting intricate homes built around swooping minecart tracks. Sometimes he builds treehouses that span forests. They also regularly go adventuring with their friends seeking treasure, avoiding creepers, and battling spiders, zombies and skeletons. They, and millions like them, can only do this because of the freedom and openness of Minecraft. The malleability of the game lets them change it to suit their mood. It does this by giving people a degree of access that Microsoft, in its business software, has never embraced. And that is what has got the millions who play Minecraft worried. Those fans do not want Microsoft to mess with their freedom to tinker with it as they please. They have a deep-rooted sense of ownership about the things they create in the game. There's no doubt that will be a tricky job for Microsoft to achieve given how critical that community can be. It will have to work hard to battle those sworn enemies of every online gamer - downtime and lag (aka delay).  It is likely that any problem with the game's availability in the future will be blamed on Microsoft - whether it is the company's fault or not. Making more drastic changes to the running of the game such as limiting how people can modify it, charging them for things that are currently free or imposing restrictions on how they can tell the world about what they have done, might, if handled poorly, turn a big chunk of that community against Microsoft. That would be bad, given that many of its players are now children who will grow up to be the gamers of the future. No doubt Microsoft is hoping to impress them with the way it handles Minecraft.

{"article": "After bowling out Somerset for 211, the Bears looked set for a two-day defeat on 61-8, chasing 184 to win, with spinner Jack Leach taking 5-33. But ninth-wicket pair Rikki Clarke (42 not out) and Chris Wright (38 not out) then more than doubled the score. Putting on 70 so far, the highest stand of the match, they closed on 131-8. Having survived the extra half hour with growing confidence, it leaves the Bears needing 53 more runs to win on day three, although Somerset will start favourites to take the two wickets they need. In a match of twists, turns and fine individual performances on a wearing, used pitch, Leach's 'five-for' was not the only one of the day. Bears spinner Jeetan Patel, the Championship's leading wicket-taker, had earlier claimed the 24th five-wicket haul of his long career, taking 5-86 to boost his tally to 64 for the season. First-innings hero Dom Bess also weighed in with two more scalps for figures of 8-59 so far on his Championship debut. And 40-year-old former England opener Marcus Trescothick got in on the act, taking three more catches. His six in the match is just one short of Chris Tavare's 27-year-old Somerset outfielders' record, but he did equal the county's career record total of 393, set 79 years ago by former England all-rounder Jack White. But a game in which Somerset were bowled out for just 95 on the first morning might already be over if home skipper Chris Rogers had not been crucially missed at long leg on six on day one. The former Australia Test opener went on to post the game's only half-century, making what could yet prove a match-winning 58 as he shared in stands of 39 with Trescothick and 55 with Peter Trego. ECB Cricket Liaison Officer Phil Whitticase was sent to view the second day's play, but it was batting errors, rather than the pitch misbehaving, which accounted for the majority of wickets. Somerset spinner Jack Leach told BBC Radio Somerset: \"It was a great day for me because first I went past 50 first-class wickets for the season, then 50 Championship wickets, before ending up with a five-for. \"It has been a crazy two days of cricket and Rikki Clarke and Chris Wright have batted really well to set up the prospect of an exciting finish. \"We still feel in a good position because they have to play themselves in again tomorrow and the ball has tended to do more for the bowlers in the morning sessions.\" Warwickshire director of cricket Dougie Brown told BBC WM: \"Rikki Clarke and Chris Wright have shown what is possible on this pitch if batsmen are prepared to apply themselves. \"Again there were too many soft dismissals in our innings and we still have a lot of work to do.

{"article": "For 60 years scientists have known that there was a bright mass on Pluto, but it was only through the increased resolution provided by the cameras on board New Horizons that detailed its distinctive heart shape. The shape, instantly beloved on social media, is believed to have been caused by an impact at some point in history. One side of the heart is smoother than the other. Researchers believe the crater is filled with frozen gases from the atmosphere - namely nitrogen, methane and carbon dioxide. However a false coloured photo from Pluto released by Nasa indicates that the heart is actually broken in two. The colours show different chemical signatures in the image. On the left it is a type of beige while on the right is a mosaic of blue, these indicate that the two parts had different geologic or tectonic origins. The initial image released by Nasa had a reddish hue, something that scientists have long known. It's very different from the other red planet, Mars, in that the colour of the more distant, tiny world is likely caused by hydrocarbon molecules called tholins, that are formed when solar ultraviolet light and cosmic rays interact with methane in Pluto's atmosphere and on its surface. \"Pluto's reddening process occurs even on the night side where there's no sunlight, and in the depths of winter when the sun remains below the horizon for decades at a time,\" according to New Horizons co-investigator Michael Summers. New Horizons has provided more accurate information on the size and scope of Pluto. It's a little bigger than expected, about 80km wider than previous predictions, making it around two thirds the size of our moon. The increased dimensions mean that Pluto is likely to be made of less rock and more ice beneath its surface according to members of the mission team. The reclassification means that Pluto is now officially bigger than Eris, one of hundreds of thousands of mini-planets and comet-like objects circling beyond Neptune in a region called the Kuiper Belt. The relative lack of impact craters on Pluto suggested by the first image could be an indication that the surface of the dwarf planet is renewing, either by geological or atmospheric activity, such as erosion. Mission chief Alan Stern says there is evidence of \"surface activity\" on Pluto, a tantalising hint of earth-like tectonics \"in its past or even its present\". Nasa have dubbed one of the strange, darker regions of Pluto the \"whale\". Researchers say it is unusual to have contrasting bright and dark surfaces on objects in our Solar System, reflecting the fact that Pluto is far more complex than previously thought. Surface temperatures on Pluto are extremely cold, ranging from -172 to -238 degrees C depending on where it is on its 248 year orbit of the Sun. Since it passed the closest point to our star back in 1989, experts assumed that after that the dwarf planet started cooling. Some computer models even predicted that the atmosphere would have fallen as snow and disappeared. That hasn't happened. But the New Horizons Principal Investigator agrees that snow does likely fall on the distant body. \"Pluto has strong atmospheric cycles, it snows on the surface, the snows sublimate and go back into the atmosphere each 248 year orbit,\" said Alan Stern. Little light has so far been shed on the moons of Pluto but the coloured image released yesterday indicates that Charon, the biggest, is covered with red material around its pole. Scientists believe that this stuff may be tholins that have escaped from Pluto's atmosphere. Experts believe that the mottled colours at lower latitudes point to a diversity of terrains on Charon. So far little detail has emerged about the other moons of Pluto except more accurate measurements of their size. Very slowly indeed. At a distance of 5bn kilometres from Earth and with a radio transmitter that can only output 12 watts, that means New Horizons is signalling across the Solar System with the equivalent power of a small LED bulb. The transfer rate is achingly slow, around 1kb per second - if things go really well it can reach a dizzying 4kb. That's slow even by 1980s standards. All this means that a black and white picture of Pluto would take over three hours to transmit. Even if massively compressed it would still take around 20 minutes. As Nasa is handling communications to several other missions at one time, it means that New Horizons has to wait in the queue for access to the Deep Space Network, the radio telescopes that communicate with distant probes. Getting all the data from the brief flypast of Pluto will take almost 16 months.", "question": "Now that the New Horizons probe has successfully flown past Pluto and confirmed to Nasa that it is all in one piece , researchers can look forward to a \" @placeholder \" of images and data from the strange , distant world over the next 16 months .

Huwel Manley, operations manager for NRW, said the new investigation aims to address \"unanswered questions\" from the 2012 study. \"Our aim is to manage a sustainable cockle fishery in the Burry Inlet that provides a regular income to licence holders, while leaving enough for stocks to replenish and to feed migratory birds,\" he said. \"We'll benefit from having full access to data collected across Europe. And we'll consider any new evidence, as well as evidence from our cockle surveys, to help us better manage the fishery in the future.\" There will be more on this story on BBC Radio Wales' Eye on Wales programme at 12.30 BST on Sunday, 25 June.", "question": "A multi-million pound project will try and establish the cause of cockle deaths in a Carmarthenshire @placeholder .", "option_0": "town", "option_1": "room", "option_2": "condition", "option_3": "estuary", "option_4": "area", "label": 3}

{"article": "\"The fall upon the bloom, will always flower in spring,\" he wistfully recites, like William Wordsworth via David Attenborough. \"But, he doesn't need your number one.\" It sounds like a crazed fever dream or maybe something out of a Terry Gilliam movie, but it's comes from the wonderful world of online campaign videos for the Republic of Ireland's general election. The election has produced a bumper crop of bizarre clips aimed at pushing candidates all the way into the Irish parliament by way of a screaming viral hit. Irish people will go to the polls this week after a whirlwind campaign period following Taoiseach (prime minister) Enda Kenny's announcement of the election at the beginning of February. Since then the internet has been flooded with videos featuring everything from musical numbers to Hollywood spoofs, with candidates keen to fight the election battle online as much as on the doorsteps. The clip described above stars Father Joe McGrath, who cryptically urges the people of County Longford to vote for independent candidate James Morgan. The video is an quirky slice of viral-ready electioneering: Fr McGrath dances, he references Ancient Greeks and that's all before he's presented amongst the bushes. Another example is from Fine Gael parliamentary member Martin Heydon, whose special effects extravaganza makes Father Joe's effort look like something out of the silent era. The County Kildare candidate's three-minute promo is a full-blown Back to the Future parody, with Mr Heydon getting accosted by 'Doc Brown' who arrives in a DeLorean. \"Quick Marty, you've got to come with me,\" he cries. \"The future of Kildare South and the country depends on it.\" In this alternative timeline, it isn't Biff Tannen and his sports almanac threatening the future but the possibility Mr Heydon won't be re-elected. Meanwhile, Doc Brown is less concerned with getting plutonium to fuel the DeLorean's flux capacitor than getting a ring road built so he can get up to 88mph. Mr Heydon's blockbuster style clip isn't the only cinematic effort filmed for the election. Social Democrat candidate Gary Gannon's video, for example, flexes some directorial muscle by featuring an unbroken long take through the streets of Dublin. Other efforts, however, are considerably more rough and ready though no less creative. Some TDs, such as independent candidates Richard O'Donoghue and Michael Healy-Rae, have looked to hit the right notes with musical numbers. This glut of social media electioneering is a \"new phenomenon that has emerged in the digital age\", said Dr Jane Suiter, a senior lecturer on politics and media at Dublin City University. \"Looking at the last election in 2011, that was expected to be the social media election,\" she said. \"But, it was still very much about knocking on doors. \"By-elections since then have seen much more social media being used, and more again now.\" According to Dr Suiter, Ireland has been heavily influenced by the political advertisements freely shown on US television - but there are elements that makes these clips unique to the Republic. \"These videos make more sense here than in the UK because of the single transferable vote election system. \"There are candidates from the same party campaigning for seats, whereas in the UK it's only a few candidates and there are more safe seats. \"Here, it's different because there's a much more crowded field of candidates, who have to stand out more to be noticed. \"These videos tend to focus on the achievements of candidates rather than the party, and what they've delivered or will deliver locally.\" Another factor, said Dr Suiter, is last year's marriage referendum in the Republic of Ireland that saw both sides heavily use online campaigning and social media to promote their message. Even the weather has played its part in the rise of the wacky political video. \"It's harder to get people to go out canvassing in February,\" said Dr Suiter. \"People have to be more creative to get their message out there.\" This is a reality that looks certain to intensify in future elections. \"Research shows that it's coming up to 40% to 50% of young people getting most of their news from their phone and social media,\" she said. \"Millennials are digital natives. The kids who are 12, 13, 14 will be the candidates soon enough and that's where they live, online. \"So it's hard to escape the fact that this will become more common,\" she said. \"There's no going back to the place where it was all about feet on the ground.\" Regardless of how people vote on 27 February, the Father Joes, County Kildare 'Doc Browns' and politically themed country tunes look set to be a permanent feature of Ireland's political landscape.", "question": "Imagine the scene - a man is @placeholder , almost hidden , from among the heavy thicket of branches .", "option_0": "celebrating", "option_1": "peering", "option_2": "watching", "option_3": "emerge", "option_4": "standing", "label": 1}
{"article": "\"We had a beautiful terrace. Now I have nothing.\" Up until a few weeks ago Ramzi was the proud owner of the Palestinian Al Mukhrur restaurant just outside Bethlehem in the occupied West Bank. Now he presides over what looks like a bomb site, a grey scar in a beautiful, small valley, still lush from the winter's rains. At the beginning of May, Israeli forces flattened the restaurant. Ramzi shows me a mobile phone video of huge yellow diggers smashing through the roof, as he and his staff looked on helplessly \"12 years' work was gone in 5 minutes,\" he says. His adjacent house where he lives with his wife and children is still standing. He says the Israelis told him they would be back to demolish that within the month. Israeli officials say Ramzi did not have the correct building permits. \"In other countries too, people build restaurants in nice pastoral places without proper authorisations. They get a warning and then after a few years they are being demolished if they don't regulate their business,\" says Yigal Palmor, an Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman. But this is what Palestinians have called ethnic cleansing. The demolition of Palestinians' homes and businesses carried out by Israel in the West Bank. The United Nations here says there has been a huge rise in such activity in recent years. In 2011 it says more than 1100 Palestinians living in the West Bank were displaced, an 80% rise compared to 2010. It says in 2012 the numbers have continued to grow, with close to 600 Palestinians losing their homes so far this year. The West Bank has been under Israeli military occupation since 1967 after it was captured in the Six-Day War, a conflict that the Arab nations lost. Under the 1993 Oslo peace accords, the West Bank was divided into three zones in what was supposedly a temporary measure meant to lead eventually to a full Palestinian state. In Area C, where most of the demolitions and evictions take place, it is extremely difficult for Palestinians to get permits to build. Much of the area is defined as a closed military zone by Israel. \"Demolitions cause enormous human suffering [for Palestinians]. More than half the number of displaced people are children,\" says Ramesh Rajasingham of the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.. \"They consequently lose access to schools, they lose access to education.\" One school under threat lies in Jenba, a small Palestinian community of more than 200 people that lies in the Hebron Hills at the very southern end of the West Bank. It is remote: half an hour off the main road and for us involves a challenging ride in a four-wheel drive. Jenba lies in Area C. When we arrive, the children in the tiny two-classroom school are midway through English lessons. \"He is tall,\" stutters a small boy as I duck my head through the doorway. Life is pretty basic in Jenba with many of the families living in caves cut into the hillside. But the village is threatened with demolition. The Israeli army wants the area for a firing zone. There has been a legal battle over the land's status running for more than a decade. The Israeli Defence Ministry is due to issue a ruling soon but a final decision could end up in Israel's Supreme Court. The United Nations estimates that more than 1,600 Palestinians could be evicted from villages in the area if the Israeli Defence Ministry wins the case. Sitting in his cave, I meet 72-year-old Hamid Jabareen, half blind and unsteady on his feet. \"If the Israeli bulldozers come here they'll have to bury me alive,\" he says. \"Where else are we supposed to go?\" His grandchildren offer me a cup of hot sweet tea, very much welcome on what is a cold, wet day. Hamid says he was born in these caves and that his family lived in Jenba for generations before him. Outside, the farmers tend to their flocks around the village well. The water facilities and toilet blocks in the area were partly paid for by the British taxpayer under a UK government aid programme. Those facilities now face demolition. The British Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt says the government has \"serious concern\" about the sharp rise in demolitions carried out by Israel. He said it caused \"unnecessary suffering to ordinary Palestinians\" and was harmful to the Middle East peace process. He said in nearly all cases the demolitions were \"contrary to international humanitarian law\". Israel insists that it also demolishes illegal structures put up by Jewish people. But what infuriates Palestinians is that while it's extremely difficult for them to build in much of the West Bank, construction on large Jewish settlements continues. Just about every country, apart from Israel, says that settlements are illegal under international law. And the settlement expansion, coupled with the demolition of Palestinian homes, is happening on land where the Palestinian and Israeli leadership have said they want to build a future state of Palestine. But it is a state that many believe is becoming increasingly unlikely. The European Union would seem to agree. It issued a statement  earlier this month, saying that Israel's settlement policies alongside the eviction of Palestinians was threatening \"to make a two-state solution\" impossible. Israel dismissed that statement as biased. Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor blamed the United Nations Office of Humanitarian Affairs here for briefing EU officials with misrepresentative data. But privately some Israeli officials admit they are increasingly concerned about criticism from the European Union. Back with Ramzi Kasiyah, standing amid the rubble of his former restaurant, he points to a hillside a few kilometres away. You can hear the dull rumble of construction. It is the Jewish settlement of Har Gilo. \"I am lost for words,\" he replies, raising his hands despondently. Ramzi has erected a sign that reads \"We'll be Back\". I ask him, somewhat incredulously, if he plans to rebuild. \"Yes,\" he smiles. \"This is my life, my land. I'll be back.\" Land remains the key issue at the heart of the Middle East's most intractable conflict.", "question": "\" Wood - fired barbecue was our speciality .

I've got quite a lot of support there already and I've not even played so hopefully I can live up to the hype when I do play and make a lot of people happy \"I think it's been a long time coming,  I've had a few times when they've invited me but it wasn't the right time for myself and my family,\" Carayol told BBC Africa Sport. \"A few of the times I've had a little injury. So I didn't really want to come and perform half heartedly. I feel like it's the right time in my career now,\"  Carayol explained. Carayol, who was born in Banjul, is targeting an appearance for The Scorpions in the forthcoming qualifiers for the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations. \"Obviously I've spoken to them.

I've got quite a lot of support there already and I've not even played so hopefully I can live up to the hype when I do play and make a lot of people happy.\" The Gambia have been drawn in Group M of the 2017 Nations Cup qualifiers, along with South Africa, Cameroon and Mauritania.

Mrs Casey, of Skewen, Neath Port Talbot, was diagnosed at 31 and has suffered up to six fits a day for the past 20 years. She said the preliminary success of the operation, previously not possible, \"offered hope\" to others. The robotic arm allows surgeons to operate on epilepsy sufferers who were previously untreatable. It is far more accurate at placing probes into a patient's brain and reduces the operating time significantly. Mrs Casey has not suffered any fits since her operation in March and said her life had \"improved 100%\".

The surgeon who operated on Mrs Casey, William Gray, a professor of functional neurosciences at Cardiff University, said the robotic arm had \"phenomenal accuracy\". He said the operation would normally take more than four hours, but with the robotic arm it took 55 minutes. \"I think it's a major step forward, this robot puts the instrument in the right place,\" he added.

{"article": "The Spaniard, who plays Dominic Thiem in the semi-finals on Friday, is just two wins from a record 10th French Open - 'La Decima' - and his first since 2014. \"It's starting to be the way it was,\" Carlos Moya, who joined Nadal's coaching team in December, told BBC Sport. \"That was one of the things that we wanted back, that the opponent feels he's playing Nadal again and if they want to beat him, they're going to have to work really hard.\" They might have to work hard but thus far Nadal's opponents haven't had to spend much time on court. The Spaniard, 31, has been getting them out of there in close to 90 minutes per match, reaching the semi-finals for the loss of just 22 games in five matches - the fewest games lost to this stage of a Grand Slam since best-of-five matches were introduced. Twelve months ago, Nadal was forced out of the tournament through injury, and two years ago he was brushed aside by Novak Djokovic. In 2017, he has looked unstoppable. There is no question Nadal has rediscovered his mojo on the clay, but opinion is divided over whether he is back to his very best. His new coach believes he's not far away. \"I think he's really close to 100%,\" said Moya. \"He's played some matches this year when his level was really good. \"It's hard to compare with the old Rafa, but I think if he's not at the same level, he's close to that.\" Nadal might be the king of clay but his game looks increasingly like hard-court tennis on the red dirt. Successful in a stunning 76% of points behind second serves, and 69% of first serves, Nadal is then winning 62% of his points in under four shots, as opposed to just 15% in rallies of more than nine strokes. And it is his most famous shot that once again dominates Roland Garros. \"The wheelhouse of the Nadal renaissance has been his forehand,\" says Craig O'Shannessy, strategy expert for Wimbledon, the Australian Open and the ATP World Tour. \"He has hit 61 forehand groundstroke winners to the semi-final, with the majority hit straight down the line.\" The image of Nadal might be of long, grinding rallies from deep behind the baseline, but the reality in 2017 is that plan A is stepping in, opening up the court early, running around his backhand and cracking a forehand winner. Nadal has missed five Grand Slams through injury, and was forced out of last year's French Open with a wrist problem which saw him also miss Wimbledon and curtail his season after the US Open. The punishing nature of his baseline game led many to speculate from the early years that his would be a much shorter career than those of his rivals. However, rested and rehabilitated, he returned at the start of 2017 to reach his first Grand Slam final since 2014 in Australia, before once again dominating the clay-court season. \"I think everybody is a little bit surprised by his performances again, but when he recovers physically 100%, he gets the confidence to fight,\" said former French Open champion Juan Carlos Ferrero. \"I think being physically fit is the key to his performances right now. \"He had no injuries in the last six months and I think it's very important for him to feel like this. \"He's also recovering balls the same as before, impossible points that in the last year maybe we didn't see from him, because he couldn't move as well.\" One of the great coach-athlete relationships in sporting history will end this year when Toni Nadal - 'Uncle Toni' - steps away from life on the tour. The 56-year-old, who made the decision to change a natural right-hander to play left-handed, will return to the family's home of Majorca to concentrate on running his nephew's tennis academy. His departure lends an extra dimension to Nadal's quest for another title at Roland Garros, the place where he and Toni began an extraordinary story 12 years ago. \"He always says one of the biggest things for him is to have his family very close,\" said Ferrero. \"So to have his uncle as somebody who is there all the time in important moments, bad times, injuries, everything - of course Toni is one of the important people he'll always have in his life.\" The succession plan is well under way, however, with former French Open champion Moya brought on board in December. \"It makes me very proud,\" said Moya. \"I know who I am with, how big in the history of this sport he is, so I try to make the most of every day I have with him. \"It's been a learning experience for me.\" There were widespread calls for a change in the Nadal team when he went through his prolonged slump, and Ferrero believes Moya's introduction will bring a new dimension to the coaching set-up. \"To have someone on the team like Carlos, who knows all the time what is going on in the match because he played on the tour, I think it's very important to have someone who can then go to the locker room and talk about the match,\" added Ferrero. \"Rafa can talk with Toni as well but Carlos went through all the matches like he did, so it's something Rafa didn't have before.\" You might think that nine titles and a 77-2 career record would make Nadal stride through the gates of Roland Garros with at least a hint of a swagger. \"I won here nine times,\" said the Spaniard, \"and every year that I won I was unbelievably happy, but every year that I came back, I was unbelievably nervous.\" If Nadal carries that feeling with him as a matter of course, the looming prospect of making almost unfathomable tennis history must be an added burden. Victory in Sunday's final would make him the first player to win any of the Grand Slam titles 10 times in the open era, and only the second ever after Margaret Court's 11 Australian Open wins. \"La Decima? No, no, no,\" said Moya, when asked if it was a subject of discussion in Team Nadal. \"You know that it's there but it's coming more from the press and the people and the fans, than from Rafa and his team. \"We know it's there but we believe also it can add some extra pressure, so we don't talk about that. \"He probably does feel more pressure at this time of year, especially here. \"Every year he's coming, he's defending champion most of the time, or if not he knows it's the tournament he has the biggest chances to win, so there's always some extra pressure here.\" There have been plenty of people keen to re-anoint Nadal as the king of clay based on his resurgence this season, but the real tests still lie ahead. The average rank of his opponents so far at Roland Garros has been 39, with Roberto Bautista Agut the highest at 18 in the world. Now comes a step up against Thiem, the young Austrian who inflicted Nadal's only clay-court defeat of 2017 with a stunning performance in Rome. Get through that, and he faces a final against world number one Andy Murray or former champion Stan Wawrinka. So is a Nadal victory inevitable? \"It's difficult to say,\" said seven-time Grand Slam champion John McEnroe. \"That's why I wanted to see him and Novak play in the semis - we could see is he really playing better than ever? \"Certainly he's intimidating, there's no doubt, and he's the guy to beat.

{"article": "Ashley Young's arrival from Aston Villa comes swiftly after the signing of Phil Jones from Blackburn Rovers, with Atletico Madrid goalkeeper David de Gea and a high-class midfield player also expected to make the move to Old Trafford. The loss to Barcelona in the Champions League final at Wembley did not exactly do United a favour but it would have confirmed in Ferguson's mind that his side was obviously on the wane. Some may have been fooled into thinking everything was OK given United's success in the Premier League but they were the best of a bad bunch last season and Ferguson is brutally realistic. I stand by my belief that he dragged those players to the title and would have claimed the crown with any of the other top sides had he been in charge of them. United were awful for long spells last season and really suffered against Barcelona - the fact they won the league was a work of art in itself How United won the title playing as badly as they did away from home, where they were abysmal on so many occasions, was almost beyond belief. Ferguson will have been well aware that they might not have been so lucky next season. Ferguson had two factors to address. First, the team was awful for long spells last season and really suffered against Barcelona. Secondly, the natural passage of time has resulted in the retirements of Edwin van der Sar, Gary Neville and Paul Scholes, while Ryan Giggs is edging ever nearer towards the end of his career. Giggs was magnificent last season but can you see him having another season like that at the age of 37? I can't. Ferguson has bought defender Jones, who is only a youngster and is clearly a signing for the future. Young, a winger, is a proven, fabulous player with great delivery who will add much. If you watched United last season, they were weak all over. The fact that they won the league was a work of art in itself, the sign of a great club and a great manager, with Ferguson as the key component. If I was Ferguson I would break the bank to land Luka Modric -he is a class act The loss of Scholes and the fact that Giggs is another year closer to the end of his career means Ferguson is almost certain to strengthen in midfield. He has been linked with Tottenham's Luka Modric and Wesley Sneijder from Inter Milan, both fabulous players. I do not know where Modric is going, or even if he is going because Spurs chairman Daniel Levy gave Chelsea very short shrift last week, but if I was Ferguson I would break the bank to land the Croatian. He fits the bill perfectly. Modric is a class act and his performance when Spurs won at Liverpool on the final day of last season was as good as it gets. When the ball comes to him, he doesn't just instinctively know his three options, he knows the best one to take. He also always has time and space in abundance - the hallmark of the great player. Ferguson will obviously recruit a goalkeeper to replace Van der Sar, who was a major reason for their success last season and has been for the last five years. De Gea appears to be the chosen one but the hardest person to replace in your team is always the goalkeeper, as proved by United's struggles to find a quality successor to Peter Schmeichel. Bringing a foreign keeper into the English game is always hit and miss because a big part of the game here is the ball into the box. We have seen the likes of Heurelho Gomes struggle to cope with that aspect of the game whereas Van der Sar was consummate and his communication skills were wonderful. De Gea is only a young boy, so it will be very intriguing to see how he goes if he does sign for United. Retirement and age have taken some of Ferguson's best players out of the equation but he is a master when faced with this sort of situation. He will also be aware of the challenges coming from elsewhere. United and Chelsea undoubtedly came back towards the pack last season, while Manchester City may feel they will never have a better chance of winning the Premier League than next time around. They will spend, Roman Abramovich will back new Chelsea boss Andre Villlas-Boas, while over at Anfield, where not much escapes Ferguson's attention, they now have the Kenny Dalglish factor. Liverpool will clearly strengthen their squad this summer and there is still the feel-good factor following Dalglish's arrival, which galvanised the whole club. Luis Suarez will also be ready for his first full season in the Premier League. The striker was sensational after coming to Anfield in January. But history tells us there is nobody better at coming out on top in a pressurised position than Ferguson. He clearly means business after taking stock of the current condition of his squad. And you would never back against him - you can't back against him - because if he can take his team to the title playing the way they did last season then they would have to start as favourites next season as he begins the process of building his latest Old Trafford model.

{"article": "Investors holding Argentine bonds and lawyers for the government attended a hearing in New York for the first time since Argentina defied an order to pay. \"Nothing that has happened this week has removed the necessity of working out a settlement,\" the judge said. The bond-holders, which Argentina calls \"vulture funds,\" are demanding a full payout of $1.3bn (Â£766m). The bonds were bought by hedge funds NML and Aurelius Capital Management for a fraction of their face value in the aftermath of Argentina's economic collapse in 2001. The South American nation defaulted on its debts at the time. It has since renegotiated its debts with 92% of the creditors who agreed to settle for one-third of they were originally owed. However, the hedge funds bought up a large chunk of the remaining distressed debt at low prices, and demand to be paid the full face value of their holding. On Wednesday Argentina refused to pay. The government had expected their dispute to go all the way to the US Supreme Court, which would have bought the country more time. In June, the Supreme Court declined to hear Argentina's appeal against the decision of a lower court that made it liable for the money. Mr Griesa ordered Argentina to pay the hedge funds and blocked any payments to other creditors. \"The only sensible way\" to solve the crisis, Mr Griesa said, \"is to go forward on the path that has been started\". Argentina has accused Mr Griesa and the court-appointed mediator, Daniel Pollack, of being biased in favour of the funds. Argentina denies it is in default. It says it has the money to pay the vast majority of its creditors and has not done so only due to the court's ruling. \"To say we are in default is a huge stupidity,\" said Economy Minister Axel Kicillof on Thursday. \"Judge Griesa took the side of the vulture funds throughout the negotiations. As I mentioned before, the negotiating table was tilted towards them,\" he told journalists. President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner addressed the nation on Thursday night to defend its decision not to sign an agreement that would harm her country's interests. She later addressed supporters at the presidential palace, the Casa Rosada. \"It would have been easier for me to sign it, but I wouldn't be able to sleep and I wouldn't like to go down in history like that,\" said Ms Fernandez. She is in the final year of her second term in office and is constitutionally barred from seeking a third term. Mr Griesa urged Argentina to focus on a solution for the problem. \"Let's cool down with ideas of mistrust. What can be trusted are facts. What can be trusted are proposals. This is not a personality contest,\" he said. Argentina fears that a deal with the investment funds would have an impact on the deals signed between 2005 and 2010. The bond-holders who agreed to settle for a third of what they were owed might be entitled to be paid in full.

{"article": "For the first time in 23 years, the country will be home to a Formula 1 race and this time, the drivers won't be the ones who have most at stake. The return of Mexico's Grand Prix is part of a bid to boost the standing of the country that has long had a reputation for being somewhat sleepy and economically impoverished. An F1 race puts it on the global sporting map alongside developed nations and trading partners like the United States and Britain. Tavo Hellmund, the American entrepreneur who was the mastermind behind the US GP in Austin and its track, the Circuit of the Americas, is one of the driving forces behind the Mexican race. He believes it is on track to attract a 120,000-strong crowd and beat all previous attendance records. But he admits that its reappearance on the F1 calendar is down to luck as much as desire. \"All of the stars have aligned to bring F1 back to Mexico as we have two hugely talented athletes flying the flag in the form of Ferrari's test driver Esteban GutiÃ©rrez and Sergio Perez at the wheel for Force India. \"We also have Enrique Pena Nieto, a dynamic young president who is passionate about motorsport and has provided the support needed to give the race a green light.\" The Mexican GP first raced onto the F1 calendar in 1963 and became a fan-favourite thanks to memorable on-track action, including victories by British world champion Nigel Mansell. He famously passed Austrian driver Gerhard Berger on the outside of the sweeping Peraltada corner in 1990 and won the country's final grand prix two years later. The race dropped off the F1 calendar because the city centre track, Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez, fell into disrepair. At the same time that upgrades were needed, Mexico was being priced out of F1. An increasing number of emerging markets were attracted to the sport and their governments were prepared to pay top dollar to host an F1 race, promoting themselves to the sport's global television audience that hit 425 million people last year. This drove up the F1 race-hosting fee, with Mexico understood to be paying $25m (Â£16m) annually to regain its place at the F1 table. It is a price that President Nieto thinks is worth paying. The 48 year-old took office in December 2012, precisely the time at which the exciting new breed of Mexican F1 drivers were emerging. Esteban GutiÃ©rrez joined Sauber in 2013, but Ferrari's talent spotters snapped him up this year. Sergio Perez started in 2011 and also began at Sauber. Two years later, he switched to McLaren before moving to Force India for 2014. He soon proved his worth by finishing third at the Bahrain GP in April last year, repeating the trick at the Russian GP earlier this month before finishing fifth in last weekend's US grand prix. This has helped rev up home support for F1 in the run up to this weekend's Mexican race. \"Projected attendance in Mexico is probably around 110,000, and when you count personnel, teams, cleaners, security you're probably looking about 120,000,\" says Mr Hellmund. It dwarves the race's peak attendance of 100,000 in 1992, according to motorsport statistics database Forix. \"They could have sold 300,000 on race day this year, but the price is a lot for Mexico, if not for Formula 1,\" says Mr Hellmund. Tickets start at $91, rising up to $1,132, which is just shy of the $1,300 peak for the US GP - the race's closest competitor geographically. The difference is that Mexico is one of the poorest nations on earth. In July, government social development agency Coneval reported that the poverty rate increased last year to 46.2%, equivalent to 55.3 million people in the nation of nearly 120 million. The population is concentrated in Greater Mexico City, which is home to 21.2 million people, making it the largest metropolitan area in the western hemisphere and the largest Spanish-speaking city in the world. It is the city's ardent fan-base that caught Mr Hellmund's attention. This weekend's race is a homecoming for him as his late father, Gustavo Hellmund-Rosas, was responsible for the Mexican GP returning in 1986 after a 15-year absence. Mr Hellmund was a born promoter and seized the moment a decade ago when the US GP was in the middle of a turbulent eight years at Indianapolis. In 2007, the city finally severed its ties with F1 and this was the catalyst for Mr Hellmund's bid to bring the US GP to Austin, where he now lives. \"It was always the plan to get Austin up and running then get a second grand prix in Mexico,\" he says. \"It has history and a personal attachment because of my father's relationship with it.\" The plan was driven by Mr Hellmund and his counterpart in Mexico, Alejandro Soberon, chief executive of the world's third largest live entertainment company, Corporacion Interamericana de Entretenimiento (CIE), which is promoting the race and leases the track. \"I had to convince Bernie [Ecclestone] that I had found the right location for the race and that I had found the right partners in CIE,\" says Mr Hellmund. F1 has raised Austin's profile internationally and Mr Hellmund is confident Mexico will share the same glow. \"I think they will sustain it for at least five years. A lot of the ticket deals sold to the public in Mexico are tied up for that long - more than 20%. There's enough of a following and a passion for motorsport in Latin America that having local drivers is not an absolute necessity, but I think it certainly helps.\" On Sunday, all eyes in Mexico will be on them.", "question": "The residents of Mexico City will be @placeholder by an unusual alarm clock this weekend .", "option_0": "woken", "option_1": "boosted", "option_2": "marked", "option_3": "greeted", "option_4": "dominated", "label": 0}
{"article": "In 2008 and again in 2012 a liberal coalition of minorities, college-educated whites and single women gave Barack Obama more than enough votes to comfortably win the presidency. Can it hold fast after he exits the stage next year? A two-term presidency can paper over a host of fissures within a political movement. The longer a party stays in power, the more competing interests are liable to grow dissatisfied with their share of the governing pie. Sometimes the centre holds. In 1988, for instance, George HW Bush rode to power on the strength of the Ronald Reagan governing coalition. By 1992, however, the foundation had given way, as fiscal and social conservatives revolted, ushering in eight years of Democratic rule and pushing the Republican Party farther to the right. At the Netroots Nation conference of left-wing activists in Phoenix, Arizona, last week, the fault lines within today's Democratic Party were on full display. And while Mrs Clinton was more than a thousand miles away, honouring \"prior commitments\" in Iowa and Arkansas, the events that transpired in the desert this weekend should give her pause. There's no question, for instance, that the enthusiasm and support for Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders' insurgent presidential campaign is real. He's climbed in polls over the past few weeks, and on Saturday night 11,000 turned out to hear the firebrand socialist give one of his 60-minute stem-winders. On the menu was a heavy dose of liberal red meat - including condemnation of the \"billionaire class\" and calls for higher taxes on the wealthy, expanding government-run healthcare programmes, raising the minimum wage and tuition-free college education. \"Bernie Sanders stands up for what's just and right,\" says conference attendee Jean Devine of Phoenix. \"He's for the Democratic ideals of equality for all people and for the rich not being able to buy elections.\" While in Arizona, campaign supporters hoisted banners and toasted their man at a local nightclub with cleverly named cocktails like \"Weekend at Bernie's\" and \"Vermont Treehugger\" (with maple syrup-infused whiskey). There was a point in time when Mrs Clinton was the cool Democrat. She had her own internet meme. She was near universally beloved by party faithful. Now, however - at least among the rank and file at Netroots Nation - Mr Sanders is the candidate of the hour. The Vermont senator has given voice to the frustration and anger that some on the left feel over the current state of US politics. They helped elect Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, but their goal of enacting a full progressive agenda seems to them far from realised. \"Bernie's looking pretty good,\" says Hanna Roditi of Connecticut. \"He's the only one who doesn't cater to corporations. The policies that he supports have more to do with people's needs.\" The most common adjectives used to describe Mrs Clinton in Phoenix, on the other hand, were \"calculating,\" \"cautious\" and \"corporate\". \"I won't vote for her,\" Roditi says, adding that if Mr Sanders doesn't win the Democratic nomination she'll write in his name on the general election ballot. The establishment - whether in the government or the Democratic Party - was a source of anger time and again at the conference. During a Thursday afternoon panel discussion, EJ Juarez, director of Progress Majority Washington - singled out Democratic campaign managers in particular for betraying their party's progressive ideals. \"We ceded a lot of the soul of our values off to contractors who don't often adopt the equity principles we talk about,\" he said. \"They aren't talking the same language.\" On Friday morning Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, a champion of the left, used her keynote address to rail against an \"insider Washington\" that ignores the liberal priorities of the nation at large - on issues like gun control, income inequality and tighter Wall Street controls. \"The American people are progressive, and our day is coming,\" she said. After calling out the financial behemoth Citigroup by name, she said the US government - even during the Obama administration - has been dominated by Wall Street insiders. She then offered some advice for candidates seeking the presidency. \"I think that anyone running for that job - anyone who wants the power to make every key economic appointment and every key nomination - should say loud and clear we don't run this country for Wall Street and mega-corporations, we run it for people,\" she said to cheers. It was likely a barb aimed at Mrs Clinton - who has been criticised by some on the left for being in the thrall of big-money donors - and set the stage for the Saturday's presidential town hall forum featuring Mr Sanders and fellow candidate Martin O'Malley. A funny thing happened on the way to the forum, however - evidence of yet another frayed fibre in the Democratic electoral quilt. Mr O'Malley took the stage first, and about 20 minutes into his question-and-answer session a group of several dozen protesters from the group Black Lives Matter interrupted the proceedings with chants, songs and shouts. Tia Oso, leader of the Black Alliance for Just Immigration, commandeered a microphone and asked the former Baltimore mayor what he would do to \"begin to dismantle structural racism in the United States\". Mr O'Malley was met by boos when he said: \"Black lives matter. White lives matter. All lives matter.\" (He would later apologise, saying he did not want to \"disrespect\" the passion and commitment of the protesters.) The demonstrations continued for Mr Sanders. At one point the senator snapped: \"If you don't want me to be here, that's OK. I don't want to outscream people\". He would later cancel previously scheduled afternoon meetings with conference attendees, including one with the Black Lives Matter group. By evening, however, the Bernie show was back. The Phoenix conference centre was packed with the campaign loyalists in a display of grass-roots support outpacing even the 10,000 who turned out just weeks earlier in Madison, Wisconsin. Unlike that Mid-west liberal bastion, however, Arizona is decidedly conservative - an indication that the senator is drawing power across the country. The true-believing left does have a history of rallying behind unvarnished candidates like Mr Sanders, however, and they have met with limited success. Paul Tsongas in 1992, Bill Bradley in 2000 and Howard Dean in 2004 are but a few of the men who failed to translate big crowds and energetic support into primary victories. Mrs Clinton must hope that the Sanders campaign meets with a similar fate - and when it does, that progressive loyalists like conference attendee Pam Miles of Huntsville, Alabama return to the fold. \"Bernie Sanders says everything that I feel,\" Miles says. \"He's a dynamo, he is a truth-teller, he speaks truth to power. I love Bernie.\" She adds, however, that she'll be happy to back Mrs Clinton if she gets the nomination. She says she's keen to avoid the kind of intra-party discord that marred the Clinton-Obama battles of 2008. \"In '08 it was absolutely horrible,\" she says. \"It broke friendships, it hurt feelings. I'm not going to do that this time.\" As for the Black Lives Matters activists who became the surprise story of Phoenix, Wesley Lowery of the Washington Post asked Mrs Clinton how she would have responded to the protesters during a Facebook question-and-answer session on Monday. \"Black lives matter. Everyone in this country should stand firmly behind that,\" she replied. \"We need to acknowledge some hard truths about race and justice in this country, and one of those hard truths is that that racial inequality is not merely a symptom of economic inequality. Black people across America still experience racism every day.\" She went on to recommend body cameras for US police officers, sentencing reform, voting rights and early childhood education. Unlike her Democratic competitors, Mrs Clinton had the luxury of time to respond to this latest challenge.

{"article": "But the Tories and Labour are today behaving as if the risk of another such shock in the current parliament is nil, because in different ways they've both limited their room to offset the impact of one. And history would teach us that the economy tends to go pop when we least expect it. So what have they announced? Well the Tories have said they would legislate within 100 days of forming a government to make it illegal for a chancellor during the life of the next parliament to raise income tax rates, VAT or National Insurance. There are a couple of things to say about this. First some will see it as a blatant admission that what politicians say, in their manifestos and elsewhere during an election campaign, isn't to be trusted. If we need a new law to convince us Tories won't put up taxes, that implies everything else they've promised during the election campaign is in the category of good intentions, which could be abandoned the moment the going gets tough. Which is hardly likely to reinforce our confidence in the political class. David Cameron would probably say he's prepared to take that risk, because he wants to reinforce the so-called brand of the Conservative Party that it will take as little money as necessary from us to maintain the public services we see as essential - and wants to imply that Labour is less responsible with our precious income. But it is odd, perhaps, that he won't make the same legislated commitment not to put up business taxes or rates, given that he has been frantically positioning the Tories as the pro-business party, in contrast to Ed Miliband's putative anti-business stance. But if businesses aren't to get legislated protection for the corporation tax and rates they pay, they might begin to fear they are the thin end of the Conservatives' no-tax-rises wedge. And then there are a couple of points to make about the conventional view of how best to run an economy. First is that orthodoxy in the Treasury for donkey's years has been that no chancellor should have his or her hands bound (one golden day there'll be a \"her\") in respect of what taxes can be increased or cut - because no chancellor can possibly have the gift of perfect foresight in regard to what economic circumstances may demand. So it is striking that George Osborne - who would presumably remain chancellor if the Tories are re-elected - has agreed that raising more money from income tax, NI and Vat is off limits - it deprives him of revenue-raising flexibility in respect of the three big taxes, which collectively are forecast to raise 65% of all taxation next year. In other words, he has restricted his fiscal room for manoeuvre by two thirds. Now that may or may not reassure voters, but it may not reassure credit rating agencies. How so? Well the UK still has one of the top-notch ratings for its debt, which helps the government to borrow at interest rates which are less than zero (adjusting for inflation). But the AAA and almost-AAA ratings given to us by assorted agencies are based in part on the idea that we have a robust economy able to raise whatever taxes are required to fill a hole, as and when the economy is knocked off track. So it is a bit odd perhaps that the Tories are sending out a signal that there are certain taxes that cannot be adjusted in an upward direction. That said I imagine any no-tax-rises law would contain some kind of force majeure clause, allowing it to be over-ridden in a fully-fledged fiscal crisis. But if that's the case, why bother with the law in the first place. So to get back to where I started, the law is only compelling at all if you believe there can't possibly be a serious economic setback in the next parliament. And that would seem an eccentric assumption to make, after looking around the world - in that the potential for accidents to occur everywhere from Beijing, to Frankfurt to Moscow is not de minimis. To be clear, a similar point can be made about Ed Miliband's pledge today that he would increase tax credits at least in line with inflation every year - in that there may be circumstances when saving a bit of money by being a bit meaner with them would be in the national interest. But in his case he is not planning a law to guarantee these increases. Or at least he hasn't spoken of such a law yet, although there are eight days left of this intriguing election campaign.", "question": "In most British people 's minds , the Great Crash and Recession of 2008 probably feels like yesterday - the @placeholder economic shock of our age , we continue to live with its noxious effects .", "option_0": "size", "option_1": "lead", "option_2": "worst", "option_3": "defining", "option_4": "decline", "label": 3}

{"article": "\"Well, I suppose Jeremy will need a Chief of Staff, won't he?\" joked John McTernan, a former adviser to Tony Blair, on his way into seeing his old boss set out his diagnosis of Labour's problems. Hours earlier, Mr McTernan had described Labour MPs who offered left winger Jeremy Corbyn their support just to ensure he made the shortlist of Labour candidates, rather than because they supported him, as \"morons\". Other occasions, when talking to Labour MPs, resemble a wake: lots of animated talk about the past, just don't mention the future. Sometimes as a political correspondent, the most telling remarks, the best quotes, are muttered in private conversations you have with politicians. It is what we call being off the record - we offer the politician anonymity, in exchange for complete candour from them. But who needs off the record with lines like this: Tony Blair was asked about Jeremy Corbyn's outlook: \"People say, my heart says I really should be with that politics. Well get a transplant, because that's just daft.\" \"We are in danger of becoming the political equivalent of Millwall Football Club. Their chant? `No one likes us, we don't care.' So said shadow cabinet minister Mary Creagh in the New Statesman. The message has even crossed the Atlantic: \"My party is suffering a relapse,\" the Shadow Business Secretary Chuka Umunna has told an audience in Washington. So what is going on? This is about so, so much more than a single YouGov poll - suggesting Jeremy Corbyn might win the Labour leadership - which may turn out to be drivel. It is, instead, about something much, much deeper. The other day on Radio 4's Today Programme, I described what was happening to Labour as \"the cries of pain of a party still deeply wounded after its heavy election defeat\". One or two Labour activists accused me of indulging in a spot of journalistic hyperbole. And let's be honest, that kind of accusation levelled at a reporter is often a fair cop. It was nothing more than a difference of opinion, some listeners told me. Well, it was definitely a difference of opinion. But here are ten reasons why it might be a symptom of much more than that: 1) Labour's defeat was, to many, unexpected. 2) The scale of Labour's defeat was, to many, more unexpected still. Net result: gloomy activists wonder what the future holds. 3) Those on the right of the party say the reason is obvious: Labour was too left wing. Net result: They argue the party has to move to the right, and point passionately and in no uncertain terms to Tony Blair as proof of it. 4) Those on the left of the party say the reason is obvious: Labour was too right wing. Net result: They argue the party has to move to the left, and point passionately and in no uncertain terms to the SNP's success as proof of it. 5) So who's the enemy for Labour? It depends who you ask. 6) A chunk of the Labour movement, its left, has, for years, felt sidelined, belittled, scorned and ignored. Suddenly, in Jeremy Corbyn, they have a standard bearer with a platform, offering a clear, socialist platform. Net result: He can give straight answers to straight questions, his supporters are upbeat and in the spotlight, his three rivals do rather more caveating, triangulating and not answering questions so clearly. Or even, whisper their critics, are being boring and saying nothing. 7) Two of the Labour leadership candidates, Yvette Cooper and Andy Burnham, served as Chief Secretary to the Treasury when Labour was in government, at a time when Labour faces questions about its economic credibility because of its time in government.

{"article": "Taylor was the most popular member of the most popular pop band in Britain. They epitomised the glamour and excess of the 1980s and Taylor has detailed his exploits in his autobiography In The Pleasure Groove. Magazines like Smash Hits and No 1 could not get enough of them - so I dug into the National Pop Magazine Archive (otherwise known as my wife's collection in our cellar) to find questions from old interviews to put to Taylor again now, to see how his answers have changed. \"When I look at some of the interviews I can't believe how arrogant I was,\" he says. Q: Do you still consider yourself a young man? If not when did you stop thinking you were? (No 1 magazine, December 1985) John's answer now: \"No, I made a very definite decision a couple of years ago [when he was 50 - ed] that I was now middle aged. And it was actually a really good decision to make, because I'd been feeling like a very tired young man for quite a few years, and making that acknowledgement, suddenly I felt like a very sprightly and hip middle aged guy.\" Back in 1985, John said he ceased thinking of himself as in the first flush of youth that year. \"That's not to say I consider myself old though. I just feel a more responsible human being,\" he told the magazine. Q: Looking back, is there anything you regret doing? (No 1, around late 1985/early '86) JT: \"Not really. Maybe I wished I'd played on Come Undone. I'd gone back to LA. We'd put that album to bed and I said: 'I'm not coming back for one more song.' Maybe it would have been a different song if I'd been there, maybe it wouldn't have been such a great song. But I'm not one for regrets.\" Back in the '80s, he said he did not like a couple of videos \"where we're mincing about\" and the title of their third album Seven and the Ragged Tiger. Q: What would you be if you weren't a pop star? (Look-In magazine, 1984) JT: \"A graphic artist.\" Wrong. The answer he gave to Look-In (the junior TV Times) was: \"An idiot!\" Q: Favourite item of clothing? (Look-In again) JT: \"Right now it's a black Balmain jacket.\" The 1984 answer was leather trousers. \"I almost said leather trousers,\" he says. \"I've got some nice leather trousers. I was looking at some this morning actually. Except now they're not really very appropriate very often.\" Q: If you were a domestic appliance, what would it be? (Look-In) JT: \"Oh Godâ€¦ [he groans in agony] A domestic appliance? A toaster.\" His original answer was: \"A fridge so I could stay cool.\" He roars with delight at this reminder of his wit: \"All right! See, you had to come up with hip one-liners like that all the time.\" How do you react to being voted most fanciable person? (Smash Hits, December 1985) JT: \"That's a lot of pressure isn't it?\" His answer to the magazine was: \"God! What do I have to do to be taken seriously?\" adding, with singer Simon Le Bon in second: \"How much did I win by?\" \"Yeah, I hated all that popularity contest stuff actually,\" he says now. \"Looking back, that wasn't such a good thing. We all got into that a little bit. Popular for what? I didn't take it seriouslyâ€¦ my ego maybe did... In the naivety of the moment it probably did mess me up a bit. It's so meaningless and it will make you lazy and complacent when you should be working to prove your bass playing and your songwriting.\" Q: What do you think of the new crop of pop stars? (Smash Hits, April 1989) JT: \"Not a lot. It's so dangerous when you get into 'in my day you had David Bowie and Queen in the pop charts'. Who's like that today? Who's written a song like Bohemian Rhapsody lately, played it themselves and put it at the top of the pop charts? It just doesn't happen any more. \"It's singers with producers, overly simplistic, lacking in soul, because it's all computer driven music that your ears will tire of very quickly. Adele is the exception I suppose.\" At the time, Taylor's answer was: \"Bros would never have been around if we hadn't been there first. I know that for a fact. They started off playing our songs.\" On hearing this, the present-day Taylor says of his younger self: \"What an idiot.\" Q: What makes you cynical? (No 1, December 1985) JT: \"Hypocrisy. People with a God complex who think they know what's best for others. I suppose people who try to control. I'm not terribly cynical actually.\" In 1985, Taylor said he disliked lawyers but was not a very cynical person, adding: \"I hate hypocrites and I hate it when anything that is artistic is controlled by non-artistic people.\" Not much change here. Q: Why are you a tax exile? (Smash Hits Book of Personal Files, November 1986) JT: \"I didn't know I was. The only time we took a year out was '83 and I don't remember planning it in advance. It was just served up for us - this is what we're going to do. We were recording the difficult third album. We did it in the south of France, the Caribbean and  finished it off in Sydney. These days I go backwards and forwards between the States and here and it's all the same tax wise.\" In the Smash Hits grilling, he was quoted as saying he did not see why, \"with a career that may at best last five years\", he should give 70% of his earnings to the government. He says now: \"I don't have a problem with tax.\" The tax aspect aside, did he only expect his career to last for five years? \"Back then, definitely,\" he says. \"You couldn't take anything for granted. I still don't, although now I know we've got a legacy that will feed us. I don't think anybody believes they're going to be around for a long time. There's footage of John Lennon saying: 'We're hoping to get 12 months out of it.'\" Q: Are Duran Duran down the dumper? (headline from Smash Hits, 1987) JT: \"Well clearly not.\" The original headline was completed by the word: \"No!\" Q: Is there a lot of pressure now to become The Biggest again? (No 1, March 1986) JT: \"There was definitely a lot of pressure then. But I stopped thinking in terms of hits a long time ago. \"I've stopped thinking in terms of an end result because I realised I kept comparing [ourselves to] the sales and chart positions we had when we were young. And it seemed like for a long time: 'Oh God we're never gonna top that. It's going to be downhill.'\" Back in 1986, as the band were losing their grip at the top of the charts, the younger Taylor admitted: \"Oh yeah. There's so much pressure.\" Q: Would you give up being in Duran? (not a pop magazine but the Los Angeles Times, March 1985) JT: \"I did leave actually about 15 years ago. I thought I'd gone for good but it was the friendship that bought me back. I could [leave now] but I love what we get to do together. That stage time is precious and I love putting on stage shows. It's my favourite thing.\" In March 1985, Taylor had just released an album with side-project The Power Station. \"I'm a star because of Duran,\" he told the LA Times. \"I love being a star. The whole circus aspect of being in Duran is a pain after a while, but it's great being a star, with the girls screaming and the money rolling in. I know it sounds greedy and awful and people will think I'm an egomaniac, but I don't care.\" On hearing this answer read back to him, he says: \"When I look at some of the interviews, I can't believe how arrogant I was. We all were. You can't help it.\"", "question": "In 1985 , Duran Duran were the best @placeholder in the world and their bassist John Taylor was most fanciable person and the second most wonderful human being alive ( behind Bob Geldof ) .

{"article": "But his fans should prepare for a change as the 42-year-old propels himself in a grittier, edgier direction, starting with Killer Joe. The movie, which opens the Edinburgh International Film Festival on Wednesday, sees McConaughey playing a twisted Texan detective who hires himself out as a contract killer. Directed by William Friedkin and co-starring Emile Hirsch and Britain's Juno Temple, the plot centres around a young man who wants to murder his mother for her insurance money. He hires \"Killer\" Joe. But when he can't pay, Joe demands the man's young sister as a \"retainer\" for the job. The film, which has an 18 certificate in the UK, depicts the detective's sexual relationship with an underage girl. It also includes one graphic and violent scene involving a piece of fried chicken that is already the subject of debate from those who have seen the film. \"Hey, this is just another light, breezy romantic comedy with chicken,\" jokes McConaughey. \"Seriously, this film is a different cat for sure. \"It's a really, really wild movie with a wild character. He is dangerous at every turn.\" The script was originally written as a stage play by Pulitzer Prize-winner Tracy Letts, whose writing has been described by fans as \"the love child of Tennessee Williams and Quentin Tarantino\". Friedkin shot the movie over a number of weeks in New Orleans, which became the substitute for Texas. The 76-year-old says he wanted to make the film because \"it's about innocence, victimhood, vengeance and tenderness\". \"I've experienced all those emotions in life and I like to put them in all my films,\" he explains. McConaughey says he was drawn to the moral duality of Joe as a character. \"Joe's charming and a gentleman on one hand - he certainly becomes Prince Charming to the daughter in that family - and yet he's a killer. \"I couldn't quite see him clearly as a character until I met with Billy Friedkin. It was Billy's affection for the story and the blasphemous humour within it which helped me understand him. \"Partly though, I took on the part for the thrill of it. You know, he's a bit scary. \"It turned me on in the right way when I was reading the script, and that hadn't happened in a while. I really looked forward to getting under his skin. \"This guy is bound by nothing and no one - not the law, religion, relationships, anything. But I still get to play Joe as a human being.\" Asked how he coped with filming the sometimes distressingly graphic scenes, McConaughey says: \"I just let it fly. \"And I was greeted by bursts of hearty laughter at the end of the scenes, so that reassured me.\" But how will McConaughey's audience react to their clean-cut hero heading down a darker path? McConaughey points out that he first came to Hollywood's attention with the thriller A Time to Kill in 1996 - a much edgier movie than the ones which followed. \"I've really enjoyed the films I've done up until now, and in the future I will do more romantic comedies. \"But right now these are the kind of characters that I've been drawn to, and they've been drawn to me too. This is what's giving me a buzz.\" All in all, McConaughey has four more films to be released over the next few months that are all departures from the rom-com stereotype. He plays the owner of a male strip club in Steven Soderbergh's Magic Mike, which is out next month. Then he stars as a journalist in The Paperboy, starring opposite Nicole Kidman and Zac Efron. He plays a fugitive in indie thriller Mud and will be seen as a cynical district attorney in black comedy Bernie with Jack Black and Shirley MacLaine. Both Mud and The Paperboy were selected for competition at this year's Cannes Film Festival - a fact that, according to McConaughey, shows he is heading down the right road. \"It is a deliberate shift for me,\" he says. \"I wanted to shake things up, do some new things, and play some roles that scared me - characters that would make me excited to go to work in the morning. \"For about 18 months though, I was still receiving offers of comedies, and some of them were very good, but I had to keep turning them down. \"I felt like I'd done them before. Then after a long period of saying no to everything, all these new scripts came and found me.\" McConaughey's gamble seems to have paid off. Reviews of Killer Joe have generally been positive with The Guardian raving that he \"freezes blood [in] a game-changer of a part\". The Hollywood Reporter notes that the \"likeably unpleasant slice of adults-only Texas noir aims at the funny bone as much as the jugular\". Will the other releases bring such plaudits?  \"If the work translates and people like it, which I hope they will, I'm happy,\" says McConaughey. \"I gave my heart and soul to this, and I also worked my butt off too.\" Killer Joe is out in the UK on 29 June.", "question": "Matthew McConaughey has become known as an actor with an impressive physique , @placeholder in romantic comedies like How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days , Sahara and Fool 's Gold .", "option_0": "displayed", "option_1": "lurking", "option_2": "robbed", "option_3": "seconds", "option_4": "arrives", "label": 0}
{"article": "Bath and North East Somerset Council (Banes) also wants healthy eating and local food promoted. Traders will be required to use more uniform stalls with a \"pastel coloured canopy\" by January 2017 to \"fit in\" with the city's World Heritage status. Some have already expressed concern at the changes. Under the proposals, buskers who play on the street and sell CDs of their own music will need street trading consent. Ed Collacott, who has been selling fine art photographs on a stall for 25 years, said street sellers were \"one of the delights\" of Bath. \"There are some amazing street traders here selling very different things and each one of us is an individual,\" he added. \"To have everything under the same canopy might not look great and it certainly wouldn't be good for my photos.\" However, Liberal Democrat deputy leader of the council, David Dixon said the changes were designed to make things look better and ensure everyone was working to the same objective. \"Our street trading scene in Bath is one of the most varied you'll find in any city,\" he added. \"We're not making a huge overhaul of the street trading policy whatsoever. It's time for our renewal [and] we did an excellent consultation. \"We had a trial over the past year for the new style canopies, which actually went down very well.\" Mr Dixon said the council would be prepared to help stall holders with the changes but added they would be expected to stick to the rules. The council also intends to purchase a number of units, for both existing and new traders, which could be rented if necessary. Sark Kenny, who runs a stall selling leather goods, said the changes to his canopy would cost him about Â£400, but he thought it might cost some traders up to Â£800.", "question": "New regulations covering the size , structure and @placeholder of street traders ' pitches in Bath have been voted through .", "option_0": "appearance", "option_1": "resolution", "option_2": "versions", "option_3": "colour", "option_4": "number", "label": 0}

The Global Calculator uses data reviewed by international experts to look at scenarios for meeting the 2C target, which scientists say is needed to avoid dangerous climate change. Led by the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc), the model of the world's energy, land and food systems suggests living standards can be maintained, but only by making sweeping changes to agriculture, transport, food and fuel. There would need be hundreds of million electric cars on the road by 2050, and the amount of CO2 emitted per unit of electricity would need to fall by at least 90%. Consumers would also need to think about switching to diets high in vegetables or eat meat from animals raised through intensive farming. Energy and Climate Change Secretary Ed Davey said: \"For the first time this Global Calculator shows that everyone in the world can prosper while limiting global temperature rises to 2C, preventing the most serious impacts of climate change. \"Yet the calculator is also very clear that we must act now to change how we use and generate energy and how we use our land if we are going to achieve this green growth.\" Dr Mike Cherrett of Climate-KIC, the EU climate initiative that co-led the project, added: \"The calculator clearly highlights that we can meet our 2C target while maintaining good lifestyles - but we need to set ambitious targets on all fronts and use innovation to address climate change.\" The global calculator builds on Decc's UK calculator, published in 2010.

{"article": "Ioane Teitiota, 39, has argued that rising sea levels in his homeland meant his family would not be safe there. His lawyer, Michael Kidd, told the BBC: \"He's very disappointed obviously, he wants to be back in New Zealand.\" Kiribati is among several low-lying Pacific nations threatened by climate change-linked problems. These include storm surges, flooding and water contamination. Mr Teitiota's wife and their three New Zealand-born children also face deportation and are likely to leave next week, reported local media. \"They said we are overstayers but we are not. We are trying to find a better life for the kids,\" his wife Angua Erika told Radio New Zealand. Mr Teitiota's children are not entitled to New Zealand citizenship. Mr Teitiota had been in New Zealand since 2007 but overstayed his visa and was caught in 2011. His deportation on Wednesday night follows a failed appeal against a New Zealand high court decision that he could not be a refugee as he was not being persecuted. The United Nations describes a refugee as someone who faces persecution at home. Mr Teitiota's appeal was dismissed in July. He was taken into police custody last week ahead of his deportation. Mr Kidd said that Mr Teitiota was planning to appeal for help from the United Nations's refugee agency. His lawyers have argued in court that he and his family would suffer harm if forced to return to Kiribati because of the combined pressures of over-population and rising sea levels, and that he would be \"persecuted passively\" by the circumstances there.

{"article": "Like elsewhere in Nepal, most people had left the makeshift camps of ragged tents and flapping tarpaulins they had taken shelter in after the first giant quake. They had been patching their houses up and dusting things down. Building little shacks if their homes had been destroyed. Anything to keep off the coming monsoon rains. Then on Monday, another huge earthquake hit and changed everything. The magnitude scale used to measure earthquakes is deceptive; it doesn't show a steady, linear progression but a logarithmic one. Each point in the scale represents 32 times the energy released. So the first quake, at 7.8, had far more force than this week's 7.3 tremor. And, compared with that first major quake, the death toll is expected to be tiny, less than a hundred. That is in part because Nepal was far better prepared this time around.  There is no shortage of emergency aid, no shortage of willing hands to help. Nevertheless this latest earthquake has done terrible damage. Anjun Bista had driven into town on his motorbike to pick up some emergency relief for his family, a tent and some food. His mother died in the first earthquake and the family home was completely destroyed. Mr Bista was on the main road through town when the great tremor rocked Chautara, rocked Nepal.  He was crushed when a building collapsed. His wife Bely was wearing the white robes of mourning when I met her in the lean-to that her husband had been building before he died.  Her face was slack with misery. \"My world has been destroyed,\" she told me. \"He was such a hardworking happy man, such a good man.\" Her two sons were crouching in the family's corrugated iron cabin.  They were also wearing white and had shaved their heads to leave one sprout of hair on the crown - another mark of grief here in Nepal. \"I am like a house without a foundation,\" she said and sighed heavily.  \"I don't think I'll ever feel safe again.\" That awful sense of insecurity is very common here in Nepal, and not just among those who have lost loved ones. In some ways Chautara was lucky when this second earthquake struck. Relief supplies were already in the town. Since the first earthquake, a neat tented village has grown up on a dusty field near the centre of town.  It is a distribution centre for aid to the district and contains a large Red Cross field hospital. Ranveig Tveitnes works with the Norwegian Red Cross and is in charge of the hospital. She says the most shocking thing about the latest earthquake wasn't the terrible injuries that some people had suffered: \"We're used to those, we know how to deal with them.\" It was the fear in people's eyes as they rushed out of their houses to the safety of the open space. \"It had been two weeks before the previous big one,\" she explained, \"and things had just started to settle down. The kids are laughing again and people are smiling and seeing that there could be a better future and then this comes and everything falls apart again in people's minds\". She says her team is bringing in trauma counsellors to help local people come to terms with their fear. It is, she acknowledges, a bigger challenge than fixing a broken leg, amputating an infected finger or even performing a skin graft - just some of the 1,000 operations the Red Cross hospital in Chautara has performed in the 10 days since it opened. Tackling this terrible legacy of fear is a bigger challenge than treating physical injuries, in part because Nepalese people are right to feel frightened. According to seismologists the pressure in the great plates that are driving together beneath the country has not yet been released.

{"article": "Media playback is not supported on this device A year on from an awful World Cup, Morgan's men have won series against New Zealand and Pakistan, and lost to Australia and South Africa. England play the first of five ODIs against Sri Lanka on Tuesday. \"We went 2-0 up in South Africa, but lost 3-2. That wasn't through a lack of opportunities,\" Morgan told BBC Sport. \"We're ranked sixth in the world and that's a reflection of how unpredictable we've been in the last few years.\" Sri Lanka, a place higher in the ODI rankings, are likely to be more at home in the limited-overs format after a Test series in which they were beaten 2-0. \"They have found it tough work since they came here,\" added Morgan before the day-nighter at Trent Bridge. \"ODI cricket comes more naturally to them, so we won't take them for granted and we are looking to ourselves to build and put performances in.\" England will be without all-rounder Ben Stokes, who is out of action after knee surgery. His absence leaves a gap at number five and will alter the balance of the England side, with the hosts considering whether to select an extra batsman or promote Jos Buttler and Moeen Ali up the order and bring in an extra bowler. Conditions in Nottingham will influence that decision - rain on Monday forced England to train indoors, though dry weather later led to the covers being removed. \"It does affect us because Ben bats at five, filling the role of batsman and bowler very well,\" added batsman Morgan. \"We don't have an answer to back-up at the moment, but it does create an opportunity for someone else. \"The wicket may have a little more moisture in it than we think, so that might sway the decision.\" Left-hander Morgan is himself in need of runs, having failed to pass 50 in his past eight ODIs. \"There's no doubt that I struggled in the winter,\" said the 29-year-old. \"The Indian Premier League gave me time to work on my game and since I've come back I feel better than I did in the winter.\" If Jonny Bairstow, England's Test wicketkeeper, returns to the one-day side, he will do so as a specialist batsman, as limited-overs regular Buttler will retain the gloves. Bairstow, so prolific with the bat in Test cricket, has struggled behind the stumps. \"Jonny has been incredible form over the past year or so,\" said Morgan. \"We've every confidence in him should he play. \"But I can see how the casual fan would be confused by the Test wicketkeeper not keeping in the one-day side. \"I spoke to someone the other day and he used the comparison of selecting a football team, saying how ridiculous it would be to change from format to format. I said if the game was only 20 minutes long, would he pick a different team? He agreed the answer is yes.\" In the inaugural Super Series, England hold a 10-2 lead after two wins and a draw in the three Tests. Two points will be on offer to the winners of each of the five ODIs and one Twenty20, meaning England need two further wins for overall victory. \"The Test boys have been exceptional and made it incredibly difficult for Sri Lanka,\" said Morgan. \"It's an unbelievable start. Now Alastair Cook hands the baton over to me and hopefully I don't let him down.\" Sri Lanka fast bowler Shaminda Eranga remains in hospital in Dublin after feeling discomfort in his chest while batting in the second one-day international victory against Ireland on Saturday. That came hours after he was banned from bowling in international cricket because of an illegal action. \"We still don't know his exact condition until he has all the tests,\" said Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews. \"I spoke to him on Sunday and he was feeling fine. \"It has been a tough 48 hours for him and we all feel for him. It was a shocking incident for all of us.\" Despite the loss of Eranga, Sri Lanka secured 2-0 series win over Ireland with a 136-run success. \"The England games won't be the same because it will be a tougher challenge,\" Mathews said. \"We have to be more skilful. \"We have been a forceful team in ODIs.

The bit about glittery pens was most definitely satire. Ofsted says it's all a myth and took to social media with coloured pens to point that out in in a pithy fashion over the weekend. But if you speak to teachers, these myths have somehow become part of the fabric of expectations. The marking workload review suggested that instead there should be a clear understanding of what is meaningful and what is manageable. On lesson planning there was a message for ministers too. In future changes should be brought in with enough of a lead in time to allow proper planning. A challenge to say the least with all the curriculum changes in England. And on data the report advocates a minimal approach to gathering only what can definitely be useful. All three reviews are short and couched in very sensible language. The test for weary teachers will be whether they do actually help common sense prevail. So back to pay. It's around now the reports from the independent public pay review bodies are usually published.  These expert panels pronounce after hearing evidence from the government, employers and trade unions. They keep a profile lower than a pancake. That means shunning the company of journalists. The School Teachers Review body report this year will make interesting reading. With little room to suggest an actual pay increase, it is the story the panel weaves around the data which will matter. Within the careful paragraphs there are likely to be some more pointed sections on recruitment to teacher training, and the retention of teachers.

{"article": "For a formerly wild horse that barely reaches shoulder-height on an adult man, Luna is an unlikely figure to help improve literacy rates in Indonesia. Luna is looked after by Ridwan Sururi, 42, in the village of Serang, in the Purbalingga region of Java island. It is a rural, tropical area, lying on the edge of one of Indonesia's most active volcanoes, Mount Slamet. In a region dotted by villages, Mr Sururi - and Luna - have become essential links between communities in recent months. In January, Mr Sururi started a mobile library called Kudapustaka - meaning 'horse library' in Indonesian. He travels between villages with books stored in boxes balanced on Luna's back. He visits schools three times a week - every Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. Sometimes he brings along his daughter, Indriani Fatmawati. Children and villagers do not have to pay anything to borrow the books and Mr Sururi has not looked to make money from the scheme. \"I love horses, and I want this hobby to bring benefit to people,\" he told BBC Indonesia. The idea for Kudapustaka came from Nirwan Arsuka a fellow horse enthusiast and friend of Mr Sururi's. \"He asked me: Can we help society through our hobby? I said I was interested, but I didn't know how.\" \"Then, he had this idea to create a mobile library using horses. I liked the idea, but sadly I didn't have any books. So, he sent me boxes of books.\" According to Unesco, Indonesia has made great strides in reducing adult illiteracy in recent years, bringing the number of illiterate adults down from 15.4m in 2004 to 6.7m in 2011. However, Unesco says there are more than 977,000 illiterate adults in central Java, Ridwan's region. As a professional horse caretaker, Mr Sururi does not own any of his own animals. So did he ask permission to use the horse as a mobile library? \"I haven't,\" he said, laughing. \"The owner lives far away from this village and hasn't visited the horses for a long time. I am a bit sad about that.\" Of the three horses he is paid to look after, Mr Sururi picked Luna as his companion. \"It was a wild horse, but I tamed it. Luna has never kicked or bitten anybody, and is very friendly when surrounded by children.\" He said he wished more people would donate books to his scheme. \"Children here love comics and story books. \"Adults, on the other hand, need inspirational and how-to books, like how to farm, that kind of thing.\" Mr Sururi dreams of one day owning his own Kudapustaka horse - and a real library too. \"I hope I can have a small library in front of my house,\" he says. \"But I know it is only a dream.\"", "question": "Adult illiteracy in Indonesia is @placeholder , but one region has almost a million adults who can not read .

Venner, 78, was a former soldier who willingly served with the French army in Algeria during the war for independence. On his return, he engaged in far-right politics, taking part in an attack on Communist Party headquarters in Paris in 1956. He joined the outlawed OAS paramilitary group, which campaigned against Algerian independence and tried to assassinate Charles De Gaulle. His OAS activities earned him 18 months in La Sante prison in Paris. In the 1970s, he turned his back on party politics and made a career writing about military history. Numerous published works include Pistols And Revolvers and a history of the Russian Civil War. In the age of the internet, he kept a blog on which he fulminated against what he perceived as threats to French identity. In his final blog post, he quoted an Algerian blogger predicting Islamists would rule France within 15 years, overturning the new law on same-sex marriage. For Venner, the prospect of Islamist rule and the reality of same-sex marriage were equally \"disastrous\".

{"article": "That's about as far as it's safe for an obvious foreigner to go. Isis (the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant) is keeping a low profile and ruling Mosul, Iraq's second city, with a relatively light hand at the moment.  It is sharing control with an array of other rebel forces - dissident Sunni tribes, disgruntled former army officers, adherents of Saddam Hussein's old Baath Party, and others. But Isis is Isis, and it has a proven track record of abducting foreigners - most recently, 49 Turkish citizens from the consulate in Mosul, who are the focus of intense negotiations to obtain their freedom. But for those of Mosul's two million or so inhabitants who didn't flee as the rebels moved in - and for the few who have come back since - life has ironically in some ways improved, at least for the moment. Residents say the many checkpoints, blast-walls and barriers which hampered movement round the city when government forces were there, have been taken down, making moving around much easier. Also gone are the frequent bomb attacks and shootings - not surprising perhaps, since the rebels behind them are now in charge. The flow of traffic going in and out of the city on the main road indicated that, superficially at least, things are back to normal. More vehicles seemed to be heading in to Mosul than coming out, and those that were coming out certainly weren't crammed with desperate refugees. \"We're just off for a family visit,\" said one man at the wheel of a car full of smiling women and children. \"Apart from services, things are fine. It's safe. But people are worried, they don't know what will become of Mosul,\" he added. \"They're frightened that the army may try to fight its way back in. We're afraid of shelling, and bombardment from the air.\" Most of those coming out of the city complained about severe shortages of water, electricity and petrol. Supplies of the latter have shot up to seven or eight times the price in nearby Iraqi Kurdistan. Women said they were not being obliged to wear the veil, although many were doing so. All said that Isis was not bothering them. But Isis militants are reported to have destroyed some of the symbols of the city's rich cultural heritage. Statues to the 19th-Century composer and musician Othman al-Mosuli and the Abbasid-era poet Abu Tammam are said to have been smashed, and the tomb of Ibn al-Athir, a 12th-Century historian who travelled with Saladin, has been razed. The tomb of the prophet Noah has apparently survived so far, despite government predictions that it would be destroyed. Has the leopard changed its spots, or is Isis just biding its time, deferring for the moment to other rebel groups it may end up clashing with, and pragmatically courting public support to make it more difficult for it to be isolated and uprooted? \"Unlike the old al-Qaeda in Iraq under [Abu Musab] al-Zarqawi, who went after the local population, these guys are posing as the protectors of the people against a tyrannical Shia regime in Baghdad,\" said a senior Kurdish politician. \"They're handling it much better, and that makes them more dangerous. It will be harder to turn the tribes against them.\" When the provincial capital of Raqqa in Syria fell to Isis and other rebel groups last year, militant rule was at first relatively moderate. But later, Isis fought with the other factions and drove them out, including the official al-Qaeda franchise, the Nusra Front. Isis then imposed its own extremely harsh brand of Islamic rule, banning music, imposing strict dress code on women, implementing severe punishments such as beheadings and amputations, and destroying churches and monuments of any kind, which it regards as idolatry. No wonder that beneath the surface, many people in Mosul are anxious about their future. The current calm may not last for long.

After reports of slow progress in Cameroon, Morocco is keen to step in. There are some countries who would like to host this competition but they should keep quiet \"Morocco will not hesitate for a second to respond favourably to any invitation to host this Nations Cup,\" said the country's FA president Faouzi Lekjaa. Caf has announced that its inspection team will visit Cameroon in September with the country having had to deny reports its preparations were behind schedule. Morocco was set to host the 2015 Nations Cup until it lost the finals following concerns over the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. The Moroccan capital Rabat hosted this week's symposium on African football, where decisions such as moving the Nations Cup from January-February to June-July were taken. This was among a raft of changes overseen by Ahmad, the Malagasy who was elected president of the Confederation of African Football (Caf) in March.

The Daily Telegraph's investigation involved Wright being introduced to members of the Far East firm, who were undercover reporters, by two football agents. \"I can just recommend players to you that I've gone and seen, and you will have to do your spicy dealing, whatever you do,\" Wright is filmed saying during one of a number of meetings. Wright says \"you know where I live\" when the subject of giving him money is raised. He tells a member of the firm \"cheers, just put it there,\" when a person hands him the envelope before the newspaper claims he left with it in his pocket.

{"article": "What is more, these peaks are all at least 1.5km high. The reason they have gone unrecognised until now is because they are at the bottom of the ocean. Dave Sandwell and colleagues used radar satellites to discern the mountains' presence under water and report their findings in Science Magazine. \"In the previous radar dataset we could see everything taller than 2km, and there were 5,000 seamounts,\" Prof Sandwell told BBC News. \"With our new dataset - and we haven't fully done the work yet - I'm guessing we can see things that are 1.5km tall. \"That might not sound like a huge improvement but the number of seamounts goes up exponentially with decreasing size. \"So, we may be able to detect another 25,000 on top of the 5,000 already known,\" the Scripps Institution of Oceanography researcher explained. Knowing where the seamounts are is important for fisheries management and conservation, because it is around these topographic highs that wildlife tends to congregate. The roughness of the seafloor is important also as it steers currents and promotes mixing - behaviours that are critical to understanding how the oceans transport heat and influence the climate. But our knowledge of the seafloor is poor; witness the problems they have had searching for the missing Malaysia Airlines jet MH370, which is believed to have crashed west of Australia. The problem is that saltwater is opaque to all the standard techniques that are used to map mountains on land. Ship-borne echosounders can gather very high-resolution information by bouncing sound off bottom structures, but less than 10% of the global oceans have been properly surveyed in this way because of the effort it involves. Dietmar Müller from the University of Sydney said: \"You may generally think that the great age of exploration is truly over; we've been to all the remotest corners of continents, and perhaps one might think also of the ocean basins. But sadly this is not true - we know much more about the topography of Mars than we know about the seafloor.\" The alternative is an indirect method that uses satellites fitted with radar altimeters. These spacecraft can infer the shape of the ocean bottom from the shape of the water surface above. Because water follows gravity, it is pulled into highs above the mass of tall seamounts, and slumps into depressions over deep trenches. Most of our maps of the gross outlines of mountains on the seafloor have relied on this approach. Key advances were made using US Navy and European Space Agency satellites in the 80s and 90s. Now, Sandwell and his team have gathered new, improved datasets from more recent spacecraft - Jason 1, which was recently taken out of service, and CryoSat, which continues to orbit the Earth today. Their denser coverage and better radar technologies have brought a two-fold improvement in the gravity model used to describe the ocean floor. This richer information trove has barely been investigated yet, but already new discoveries are jumping out. These include an extinct ridge where the seafloor spread apart to help open up the Gulf of Mexico about 180 million years ago. And in the South Atlantic, the team sees the two halves of a different type of ridge feature that became separated roughly 85 million years ago when Africa rifted away from South America. The striking thing is that many such structures are often covered by deep sediments and only become visible in the new gravity data. Seeing all the major fracture zones in greater detail is sure to be a boon to those who study the history of Earth's shifting continents. The team hopes to improve still the resolution of its model. This will come as Cryosat continues to take more measurements in the years ahead. The irony here is that the European Space Agency mission is really dedicated to tracing the shape and thickness of polar ice fields - not the shape of the seafloor. \"CryoSat's orbit and payload were designed to meet its primary ice mission goals, and extending its coverage to the ocean was on a 'let's see what we get' basis,\" said principal investigator Duncan Wingham. \"As it has turned out, we now have a marvellous new view of the ocean floor.\" For its ice work, CryoSat works in a specific high-resolution mode, which could be extended to more areas of the ocean to garner improved seafloor data - if mission time allows. Ultimately, though, researchers would like to see a dedicated mapper that was specifically tuned to the task. Walter Smith, a co-author on Thursday's Science paper, proposed just such a mission in 2001 called ABySS. It was not accepted then, but the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration scientist believes the case is still a compelling one. \"The miniaturization of computer chips and the increase in CPU processing speed and data storage in the last 13 years has made it easy and cheap to do amazing things with radar,\" he told BBC News. \"There is still a lot we could do with a dedicated mission.

{"article": "The early exchanges between Owen Smith and Stephen Crabb summed up the central question: are people feeling the economic recovery? Owen Smith's claim was that there was an \"epidemic\" of insecurity in the jobs market and growing inequality as reflected in the rise in the use of food banks under the Conservative-led coalition. The counter claim from Stephen Crabb was to accuse Labour of portraying the Welsh economy as being \"Victorian\" when most of the new jobs are full time and permanent. Whoever wins on Thursday will have done so by persuading people to trust them on the economy. Another feisty exchange related to the formation of a government in the event of a hung parliament. Owen Smith openly floated the idea of a Labour minority administration, and dared Leanne Wood to ensure Plaid Cymru didn't oppose it in a way that would allow a Conservative government in. This is Labour's strategy. A formal coalition and an informal deal with the SNP have been ruled out.  Labour leader Ed Miliband pressed the nuclear button on Thursday when he even went as far as to say that, in effect, he would prefer to be in opposition than do a deal with the SNP. It was a clear indication that Labour is preparing for a minority government and it will dare the nationalist parties to bring its legislative programme down. But Plaid says it'll only fail to support a programme of government from Labour if it fails to address its concerns, so if the minority government falls then Labour has no-one to blame but itself. The prospect of a blame game between Labour and the nationalist parties falls into the hands of the Conservatives who are trying to make political capital out of it at every opportunity. I expect we'll hear plenty about moral legitimacy over the next few days. A senior Welsh Conservative suggested to me that he felt Labour would be able to form a government even if it had up to 15 fewer seats than the Conservatives but if that figure rose to between 30 or 40 then Labour would struggle to carry the moral legitimacy argument. Of course it's not a question about being the largest party but about being able to form a government. The former Welsh Secretary Paul Murphy told Radio Wales on Sunday morning that Labour could justify governing without being the biggest party if most of the MPs in the Commons were from the left. The big winner from last week's debates was the audience. The campaign so far has been stage managed with little exposure of the political leaders to the public, or the group that are referred to in newsrooms as \"real people\". Like elsewhere, this has happened in Wales. David Cameron has been in a brewery, a timber mill and the Royal Welsh showground where he addressed party members. Ed Miliband has come closer to being exposed to the public with his people's question time sessions in Cardiff and Barry in recent weeks. A quick word on Plaid's involvement in the UK-wide debates. Senior figures tell me they were expecting plenty of coverage in the media that traditionally covers politics as a result of Leanne Wood's participation in the UK leaders' debate - but the extent of the interest in her has caught them by surprise.

{"article": "Tinder leads the market in the UK, boasting 26 million \"matches\" per day globally. The company says it broke its own records last Valentine's Day as people flocked to the app looking for love. Behind the app is dating giant Match, which also owns other big names including match.com, OKCupid and Plenty of Fish - but there are plenty of start-ups hoping to charm singles and top the app store charts. \"Whatever competitors do, they will need to be cash rich and able to support the business to stand a chance of success,\" says Paolo Pescatore, director of Multiplay and Media at CCS Insight. \"But there is scope for new players to emerge that focus on a specific niche.\" Combining match-making with games and quizzes, DatePlay is designed to generate \"more meaningful matches\" than its rivals. Behind the app is entrepreneur Vana Koutsomitis, who first pitched her idea on the BBC television series The Apprentice. She did not win Lord Sugar's investment - he judged the project too risky - but she has continued work on her app, which she hopes will make online dating more fun. \"If you sign up for any of the online dating sites that focus on meaningful relationships, you'll be asked to fill out tonnes of questions about yourself,\" she says. \"What we're doing is making an interface that is a game instead of these self reports.\" Singles hoping to challenge strangers to a round of battleships or gin rummy will have to look elsewhere, for now. The app will be launched with its first game this summer, with more added later. \"Our first game is a Buzzfeed-style game where you will be answering questions about your preferences in terms of photos. You'll work through it in a fun and interactive way.\" One concern raised on The Apprentice was that people might spend all day playing a game, only to be matched with somebody they did not find attractive. But Koutsomitis says playing for longer improves your chances of finding the perfect date. \"As you continue to play the game we continue to get more data about you... that allows us to match you with better people,\" she explains. \"We think it's more important to have a few meaningful matches.\" In a bid to cut out \"creeps and timewasters\", Hanky lets existing members decide whether new joiners should be allowed in. The app, for men only, launched in January. At the time, founder Jonas Cronfield boasted: \"Our users are nicer and more sexy.\" But critics say Hanky fosters superficiality and superiority, by providing an environment where people are judged on their appearance. And while it is not the first dating service that lets people judge others on their looks, critics say the app divides a community that has fought discrimination. The company insists it has good intentions. \"The vetting system is there just because we are trying to narrow it down a little bit, it's trying to help people not waste so much time on these apps,\" says Johan Andersson, the firm's chief evangelist. \"The process of joining is harder than normal. You can't just go on there, upload a photo and start chatting to people. By the time you're approved, if you're still just looking to waste people's time, you've gone through a lot of trouble to do that.\" The app has attracted 85,000 members since its launch - although many more have tried to join. Andersson says eight out of 10 applicants are rejected by existing members. A system that can validate members' identities has an obvious appeal to a community of men that has been targeted by criminals through rival apps. But critics say Hanky's self-regulating process falls short, letting members judge whether new joiners are \"creeps\" or \"timewasters\" just by looking at their photographs. \"The point was never to stop crime,\" says Andersson. \"We can take no responsibility for what happens between two people when they communicate online.\" While other apps focus on providing you with a wide choice of singles, Once strives to provide quality over quantity. The app allows you just one match a day, hand-picked by a human curator and delivered to your phone at noon. Daters have 24 hours to initiate a conversation and move things forward, before their \"match\" disappears and is replaced with a new one to consider over lunch. \"You have 24 hours of full, undivided attention,\" says the app's creator Jean Meyer. \"There's nobody else, no noise. It's a special moment for 24 hours.\" A special moment, or perhaps 24 hours of awkward silence. While rival apps such as Tinder give you plenty of people to scroll through, with Once there is no skipping ahead, and your first \"match\" is chosen by a stranger. \"Anybody can pick someone who is very good-looking and smart, that's easy. But you need this person also to like you,\" explains Meyer. \"When we have a matchmaker forcing you into a match, you have a lot of chances that the person you're being matched with is also going to like you.\" Rejection is easy to accept on Tinder, where a new match is only a swipe away. Does Once risk upsetting people who could go a week without anybody saying hello? \"It's a dating app, not a self-esteem app. It's not about boosting your ego, you have Instagram for that,\" says Meyer. One in three matches turns into a conversation, he reassures me. And those unhappy with today's match can take control and choose somebody they would like to speak to from a list of 10. But they won't be offered up for conversation until at least noon the following day - and with a maximum of seven introductions a week, finding \"the one\" could be a lengthy process. \"If you pass, your next match is going to come the next day, so you can do something else,\" says Meyer. \"Go take a hike, or walk, or go to the movie theatre with your friends... don't spend three hours swiping, because technology should help you gain time not waste it. \"When you're done with your match of the day, do something else - please!

{"article": "Media playback is not supported on this device Rooney was set to leave United before signing a deal worth £250,000 a week. \"I told them I did not think it fair that Rooney should earn twice what I made,\" Ferguson says in a new book. \"[United co-chairman] Joel Glazer said: 'I totally agree but what should we do?' It was simple. We just agreed no player should be paid more than me.\" In his new book on the art of management, Leading, Ferguson also describes the transition following his 2013 departure from Manchester United after 26 years in charge, saying: \"We should have handled it better.\" The Scot, who won two Champions Leagues, 13 Premier League titles, five FA Cups and four League Cups at the club, was replaced by David Moyes, who was sacked after 10 months and failed to lead the club into Europe's premier club competition. But the 73-year-old says he also wished to speak to former Barcelona and now Bayern Munich boss Pep Guardiola before he appointed the former Everton manager. He also details how Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho, former Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti, Borussia Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp and then Netherlands boss Louis van Gaal, now at United, were all considered as potential replacements. \"I admired [Pep] greatly,\" Ferguson said after meeting him in New York in 2012. \"I asked Pep to phone me before he accepted an offer from another club but he didn't and wound up joining Bayern Munich in July 2013. \"When we started the process of looking for my replacement, we established that several very desirable candidates were unavailable.\" In his book, he also speaks about: Ferguson, now a United director and lecturer at the Harvard Business School, has also discussed a number of other subjects in a wide-ranging Football Focus interview. The most successful Manchester United manager of all time says he only worked with four players he considered to be world class during his time at the club. From those successful teams, he says midfielder Paul Scholes and attacking trio Eric Cantona, Cristiano Ronaldo and Ryan Giggs were his best players. \"They made the difference and the evidence is there,\" he told the BBC's Dan Walker for Football Focus. Ferguson described Cantona, who United signed from Leeds in November 1992, as \"the catalyst\", for winning his first Premier League title. He added: \"The younger breed like Ryan and Scholes were just fantastic players and the thing about those two was longevity. \"Are there players who have played right through the whole of the Premier League and performed at the level they have? There are none, absolutely none. \"Of course Ronaldo was just a complete genius of a player.\" England captains Wayne Rooney and David Beckham, Roy Keane, Carlos Tevez, Rio Ferdinand and Peter Schmeichel were all \"great players\" according to Ferguson. \"But these players elevated themselves above all that.\" Ferguson believes current United manager Van Gaal pulled off a masterstroke by appointing Giggs as his assistant at Manchester United. Giggs, 41, won 34 trophies under Ferguson, making him the most decorated player in English football history, before retiring in 2014. Ferguson told BBC Sport: \"Louis made a great choice because of Ryan's knowledge, his time at the club and his ability.\" After Moyes was sacked before the end of the 2013-14 season, Giggs took charge for the final four games. And when Van Gaal was appointed at the start of the 2014-15 season, one of his first decisions was to make Giggs assistant manager. Ferguson added: \"I think Ryan seems to enjoy that he is learning off a man with great experience. It's working.  There is good communication, Ryan's working very hard and picking up things from a foreign coach which is different from the way I operated so it looks as if it's going OK.\" Ferguson revealed how he likes watching the pre-match news conferences and how he sometimes gives advice to managers facing the cameras, including to Leicester manager Nigel Pearson when City were struggling to avoid relegation from the Premier League last season. \"I felt he was a little bit too casual,\" said Ferguson. \"I said 'Your team is bottom of the league and you have to show your anger a little bit. The fans want to see you care.' \"He improved after that and so did his team. He did a great job.\" Leicester avoided relegation but Pearson was sacked in the close season. Ferguson was twice approached about the England job but said he never considered it because he's a Scot.  He was \"never close to it\" even though former United chairman Martin Edwards twice gave the Football Association permission to speak to him about it. \"One it's an impossible job. The pressure on the England manager is huge,\" he said. \"Every competition, for some reason the press make them favourites, or one of the favourites, and to my mind they have never been favourites. \"The fans also get lit up by the press observations. The huge army of fans they take to the World Cup or the European Championships is fantastic but brings pressure.\" Ferguson is still heavily involved in football, working for European football's governing body Uefa and as a Manchester United director, but he does not hanker for his old job. \"You miss the staff at Carrington and the players in the dressing room but the only time I really felt I missed it was at the 2014 European Cup final between Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid,\" he said. \"It's all about European finals. I was involved in four but I wish it was more. I lost three other semi-finals where we should have done better and on other occasions we were a bit unlucky. \"At the end of the day it's a wonderful tournament, the best in world football.\" Ferguson was famous for giving players the \"hairdryer treatment\" but admitted he got calmer as he got older. \"I didn't need to lose my temper as much,\" he said. \"When I was young I was ferocious. I just wanted to rule the world so my anger would be obvious. \"As I got older you choose your moments and sometimes I would manufacture that anger with no reason at all and at other times you just have to keep quiet.\" Ferguson also talks about the importance of having the courage of your convictions and cites American president John F Kennedy's reaction to the Cuban missile crisis in 1962. \"JFK had his own convictions about the state of affairs regarding the Cuban crisis,\" said Ferguson. \"All his generals wanted him to bomb Cuba out of existence. \"He wouldn't take that advice and stood by his conviction there was a solution to the problem. It was a bit like Russian roulette and who was going to blink first. \"He continued down that path and it certainly worked.\" Watch the full interview on Football Focus, Saturday 26 September, 12:10 BST on BBC One and the BBC Sport website.", "question": "Former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson demanded that his salary was @placeholder in the aftermath of Wayne Rooney 's big pay increase in 2010 .", "option_0": "justified", "option_1": "overwhelmed", "option_2": "doubled", "option_3": "cradled", "option_4": "inspired", "label": 2}
{"article": "England resumed in Barbados 107 ahead at 39-5 but, despite an unbeaten 35 from Jos Buttler, were all out for 123. It left the hosts with a target of 192 and they were 80-4 before Darren Bravo and Jermaine Blackwood shared 108. Left-hander Bravo struck three sixes in a magnificent 82 and Blackwood was 47 not out as the hosts beat England for only the second time in 29 Tests. The match had fluctuated for much of the three days but the Windies were able to regain a share of the Wisden Trophy with relative ease as the England side tired. A key moment proved to be a fumbled stumping by Buttler with 105 needed, the wicketkeeper unable to gather a sharply turning ball down the leg-side when Blackwood was way out of his ground having danced down the pitch to Joe Root. After a wretched World Cup campaign, when failed to progress beyond the initial group stages, defeat at the Kensington Oval is likely to leave the England coaching staff with some difficult questions to answer from the hierarchy at the England and Wales Cricket Board. Incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves said before the start of the series that there would be \"some enquiries\" if they failed to win in the Caribbean, and he takes up his post on 15 May. Yet having scrambled for runs in frantic style at the end of a remarkable second day on which 18 wickets fell, England calmly added 23 on the third morning. The introduction of slow left-armer Veerasammy Permaul soon saw Gary Ballance caught at slip, but Ben Stokes played in positive fashion, unleashing some effective reverse sweeps to add 33 with Buttler, who got off the mark in fine style with a six off Permaul. However, Stokes skewed the spinner to cover and tall seamer Jason Holder struck with successive balls. The destructive Buttler blazed four fours and a six from the next seven balls he faced but the number eight was again left not out at the other end when last man James Anderson was lbw after a review. The home team's reply began one over before lunch and the afternoon soon appeared ominous for England when, for once, Anderson was unable to trouble the batsmen. Debutant Shai Hope was dropped by Root at third slip off Stuart Broad, with star catcher Chris Jordan inexplicably positioned in the outfield, and both reviews were wasted within the opening 11 overs. But Jordan trapped Hope lbw with a full delivery angling in, upheld after a review, and then produced another astonishing reflex catch at slip in the next over to snaffle Kraigg Brathwaite off the spin of Moeen Ali. The Windies added 35 and appeared to be in command again, but England restricted the scoring and Broad nipped one back to rattle through the defence of Marlon Samuels. Things changed once again after tea, as Bravo launched the first ball of the session from Root for six. But in the next over the veteran Shivnarine Chanderpaul chopped Anderson on to his stumps, ending a disappointing series for the 40-year-old, who averaged only 15 from his six innings. With all results still possible, a fourth day seemed likely but Bravo and Blackwood mixed defence and attack with great assurance. Bravo edged Anderson through a vacant second slip area and, though he was well caught by Broad at mid-off with only four needed, the acceleration had been decisive and the Windies, who had lost their previous two series in England, soon completed a famous victory under the floodlights.

{"article": "Tests at Guanabara Bay have revealed high levels of bacteria and viruses coming from human sewage. Two sailors contracted infections at a test event in August, which they claim were caused by the waters. Rio Olympic organisers said earlier this month that the health and safety of athletes is \"always a top priority\". Seven of the 10 sailing events in the Brazilian city will launch into the Marina de Gloria, where the new pipeline is due to open this month. \"The Marina area is our biggest challenge; it's critical it's completed and we start seeing a difference,\" World Sailing's head of events Alastair Fox told BBC Sport. \"It's essential that it improves radically - from a health point of view and also for showcasing the sport.\" Nearly 70% of sewage in Rio is spilled raw into its surrounding waters. Sailors have also reported seeing pollution, including furniture and floating animal carcasses, while drug-resistant \"super-bacteria\" were found in the area last December. A statement from the Rio 2016 organising committee earlier this month said: \"There is no doubt water within the field of play meets the relevant standards.\" The Games begin on 5 August. Following the test event at Guanabara Bay in August, German sailor Erik Heil and South Korean windsurfer Wonwoo Cho both attributed their illnesses to the water quality. However, World Sailing says the 8% illness rate at the event was lower than average for regattas. It also says doctors feel those illnesses could have been prevented, and believes athletes can minimise the risks by following hygiene guidelines, such as taking showers after exiting the water. British two-time Olympic champion Sarah Gosling, now the athletes' representative on the World Sailing council, believes the pursuit of Olympic gold will outweigh any risks involved in the minds of competitors. \"Winning a gold medal will make up for anything - it's really not that relevant,\" Gosling told the Associated Press on Tuesday. \"There are plenty and plenty of reports out there about athletes who their whole life is about winning medals, and anything that happens on the way is kind of irrelevant. \"For sailing to be in the centre of the Olympics right there, for athletes to be able to stay in the village, to be able to go to the opening and closing ceremony, it's a massive deal.\" World Sailing has had reports the rubbish in the water at Guanabara Bay, where Marina de Gloria opens into, is higher than usual because of rainy season deluges washing items into it. Fox will conduct the latest site visit in late January to assess progress. \"We're doing as much as we can to work with the Rio authorities,\" he said, adding World Sailing also had back-up plans to treat the water should the work not be completed. \"When racing near a big city, water quality is always an issue. We've no intention of not holding the competition there.

{"article": "The job numbers could be worse, with unemployment on a downward trend, most recently at 5.1%. But the most recent figures, for autumn, are worse than summer, when they could be a lot better. Across the whole of the UK, they are. The British economy has been a job-creating dynamo as it clambered out of the Great Recession trench. But much less so in Scotland. In the year leading up to the September-to-November survey, published this week, unemployment fell by 12,000. That's good. But of those aged 16 to 64, the number of people in work fell by 49,000, and the number inactive and not making themselves available for work was up by 59,000. That's not so good at all. There have been some more promising numbers recently. For instance, a Bank of Scotland survey found the number of new business start-ups was down in Scotland, but by far less than the UK. Relatively good. The Purchasing Managers Index for December, from the Bank of Scotland and Markit, edged above the point at which it returns from contraction of output to very modest growth. Good, but only just. That's while the quarterly survey out today from the Scottish Chambers of Commerce is \"finely balanced\". Firms were more likely to be positive about the fourth quarter of 2016, except in the (very large) finance and business services sector. So yes, there are signs of resilience about the Scottish economy that were not evident this time last year. But it is precarious. For two years, there has been a clear divergence in growth between Scotland and the rest of the UK. That's growth, as in Gross Domestic Product, and as measured by Scottish government statisticians. Remember that gap matters far more when it translates into income tax revenue. If Scotland can't keep up growth, receipts will, over time, fall behind the amount that would otherwise have come from the Treasury. And the weakness of the growth has begun to look quite sustained. Over the past six quarters, two have seen no growth, and three have seen a paltry 0.2% (the more positive figures for April to June last year have been revised downwards). In the most recent quarter, and over the past two years, Scotland's economy has been growing at about a third of the rate of the UK as a whole. The business view of this is becoming increasingly concerned and impatient. That is particularly as it watches Holyrood budget negotiations focus on options for increasing tax and shifting priorities across public sector spending. Nurturing economic growth, which can be helped by decisions taken through the tax system, as well as training and infrastructure, does not seem to be getting the highest priority across the Scottish Parliament. And amid the febrile atmosphere of Brexit, the UK government has less headspace or political capital available for the economy. Indeed, this week's speech from the prime minister explicitly chose the curtailment of immigration over the optimisation of economic growth and prosperity (that's in the eyes of the vast majority of economists - other opinions are available from a smaller band of Brexiteer economists). The other response is to question whether Gross Domestic Product matters as much as economists say it should. The Scottish government has a project running to find other good targets at which it can aim. The Office for National Statistics is trying to develop a wellbeing index, much of which seems to be aimed at subjective responses to surveys about sentiment. Meanwhile, from Scots economist John McLaren comes a refinement of GDP, to \"active growth\". An alumnus of the civil service and Labour government, he says we can better understand the underlying trends in the Scottish economy if the noise is stripped out of the statistics. So no more \"administration and defence\".  Although health, schooling and justice are highly important to the economy, their output is notoriously hard to measure meaningfully. Gone too is finance, for which it has proven difficult to measure output with much accuracy. And construction is seen, by this reckoning, as investment. It has also been a very important part of keeping Scotland out of recession over the past two years. What's left? \"The private sector, day-to-day activity, including manufacturing and non-finance services,\" says McLaren - \"the active elements of the economy rather than the 'passive' public services.\" By that reckoning, the active economy grew at 6.6% between 2008 and 2015, slightly faster than the Scottish economy as a whole, but while the UK \"active economy\"' grew 12%. Since the start of 2015, Prof McLaren says that active economy has contracted slightly, whereas for the UK, it has grown by more than 4%. And adapting the most recent Scottish government figures for July to September, the active economy contracted slightly over the preceding quarter and by slightly more over the previous year. The main explanation is that private sector services have been sluggish in Scotland - much less so south of the border. The notion of measuring the \"active economy\" is not officially approved, or statistically road-tested. It isn't so easily comparable as straight-forward GDP. It dodges the challenge of trying to measure output from public services. But it is another way of seeing that Scotland's economy is at best precarious, and seems to have deep-seated problems.", "question": "Grim : the most common word used by those @placeholder on the latest Scottish economic data .", "option_0": "gathered", "option_1": "reflecting", "option_2": "caught", "option_3": "arriving", "option_4": "relying", "label": 1}

{"article": "Dominic Chappell headed up a group called Retail Acquisitions, which bought BHS from Sir Philip Green for a nominal Â£1 in 2015. He told the BBC's Newsnight: \"We could have saved BHS\". Mr Chappell said he was \"upset and devastated\" about the company going into administration, but that he had no regrets about doing the deal. Mr Chappell blames two things, though, for the failure of his plan. Firstly, Christmas trading, which is the mainstay of any big retailer, was well below expectation. Secondly, he says he was badly affected by the decision of the pensions regulator to launch an inquiry into the takeover of BHS, known as an anti-avoidance case. Mr Chappell maintains that the effect of that case was to make it almost impossible for him to get credit from frontline banks, pushing him to take on high-cost loans in order to cover costs. He borrowed at an interest rate of 15% and says \"the impact of the regulator is one of the main things that knocked us over\". Mr Chappell has faced criticism ever since his deal to buy BHS was announced. A man with no retail experience, he has been declared bankrupt three times - although Mr Chappell told me that he expected one of those bankruptcies to be annulled within weeks. His lack of experience has raised questions over whether he was an appropriate man to buy such a large business. However, those close to the deal insist that Mr Chappell came across as a perfectly legitimate businessman, with colleagues who were experienced in corporate turnarounds. He also had advisors from two of the City's best known firms - accountants Grant Thornton and law firm Olswang. \"My portrayal has been too harsh,\" said Mr Chappell. \"Yes I've had two bankruptcies, but the long and the short is that I had a strong board, internationally renowned companies representing me, and I was prepared to spend a lot of money on BHS. \"We were faced with some serious problems. We reduced the overheads of the company and I am confident that, if we could have kept trading, we would have been breaking even in September of next year.

{"article": "Changes include the treatment of research and development and pensions. The ONS has calculated that the changes mean GDP for 2009 will be revised up by 4.6%, or £65bn. The changes will apply retrospectively, but 2009 is the most recent year that has had its figures updated so far. How the changes to the absolute level of GDP will affect the figures for GDP growth, which is the most closely-watched figure on the UK economy, will be announced on 30 June. Most of these changes have been made by statistical bodies across the world to help make their data comparable. Of the £65bn increase to GDP for 2009, £22bn comes from the decision that spending on research and development should be treated as an investment by companies, not just as normal spending. A contribution of £23.6bn comes from changes to the way the ONS treats non-profit institutions that provide services to households. These include organisations such as charities and religious institutions, which often provide their services for free, but the cost of providing the services is still included in the national accounts. Another £3.5bn comes from the reclassification of government spending on \"military weapons of destruction and the equipment needed to deliver them\", which also now count as a capital investment. There will be £9.7bn added due to the inclusion of illegal drugs and prostitution, as discussed in a previous article on calculating the sex and drugs economy. The level of GDP will be raised £5.1bn by new treatment of defined benefit pension schemes (the ones where you know how much money you will end up receiving), which will also have the effect of doubling the country's savings ratio. There will also be small effects from removing the minimum price at which buying small tools can be considered to be an investment, as well as changes to assumptions about how much will have to be spent decommissioning oil, gas and nuclear infrastructure.

{"article": "After several years working away from the UK, Catalan director Calixto Bieito is back with a radical reinterpretation of Shakespeare. In his new work Forests, Bieito has combed the Bard's complete works for mentions of trees, heaths and woodland. The result is, he admits, a work where even Shakespeare scholars will struggle to identify all of the references. But audiences at The Old Rep Theatre, Birmingham, can expect scenes influenced by As You Like It's forest of Arden and the moving trees of Macbeth's Great Birnam Wood. \"There are so many forests and trees in Shakespeare,\" says Bieito, talking ahead of Tuesday's opening night. \"I wanted to make an open show with a new plot using the words of Shakespeare like a symphonic poem. I'm much more interested in this than the plot.\" Forests marks the Catalan director's first work in the UK since 2004. His previous UK theatre productions include Hamlet and Celestina, both for Edinburgh Festival and Birmingham Rep, and Macbeth at the Barbican, while his opera productions have included Un Ballo in Maschera and Don Giovanni for English National Opera and Die Fledermaus for Welsh National Opera. Bieito's interpretations have often stirred up controversy. His raunchy production of Die Fledermaus in 2002 shocked audiences with an orgy, violence and strong language. He also ruffled feathers with his ENO productions of Don Giovanni and Verdi's A Masked Ball. The latter opened with a dozen men sat on lavatories and featured homosexual rape, satanic sex rituals and masturbation. The BBC's home of 2012: Latest Olympic news, sport, culture, torch relay, video and audio In 2004, Bieito caused a scandal in Berlin when his Abduction from the Seraglio shifted Mozart's opera to a modern-day brothel. The hero was a cross-dressing pimp who slaughtered the prostitutes at the end of the night. \"You say all the time I'm a bad boy,\" says Bieito, \"but I'm more interested in philosophical things.\" He originally wasn't keen to take on the latest project when he was approached about a commission for the World Shakespeare Festival. \"When they asked me to do Shakespeare I decided I would not do more. In two years I'd already done Hamlet, Macbeth and King Lear in five different languages . At the end of King Lear I was exhausted.\" But Bieito re-read the complete works of Shakespeare, including the Sonnets, in under three months. \"I've done 12 Shakespeares in different languages,\" he says  modestly. \"I'm a fast reader.\" It was a chance remark from his wife that planted the seed of an idea. \"We were talking about our children, and she said she would like to see them growing up like trees. Maybe it was this sentence that made me think about forests.\" Bieito has no qualms about chopping up Shakespeare's prose for his arboreal venture. He cites film director Luis Bunuel as an inspiration. \"You don't need the story, the show is full of pictures. You'd have to be a Shakespeare specialist to recognise everything.\" Presented by Birmingham Repertory Theatre and Barcelona Internacional Teatre, Forests features a cast of English and Catalan actors. So what can audiences expect? \"They will identify with what the show says about childhood and the violence that exists in the world,\" Bieito says. \"It's like going to a concert and you feel emotions but you don't know where they're coming from. \"Shakespeare's words are out of context, but they are much more free. They are not a slave to the plot - they get a new dimension.\" Forests is at the Old Rep Theatre, Birmingham, until 15 September, and the Barbican in London from 6 to 10 November.

{"article": "They held it two days before the anniversary, on a Sunday, in the hope that it would attract more people. But the crowds were thin, and it was only the enthusiastic participation of T-shirt sellers, face-painters and assorted performers that really kept the event alive. And of course the extraordinary, decent forbearance of the NOKs, as they call themselves, the next-of-kin, as they once again recounted memories of lost loved ones, quite literally lost somewhere in the southern Indian Ocean. But you could not escape the weariness in their voices as they appealed not to be forgotten. Another year has passed, and, notwithstanding the discovery of a barnacle-encrusted flaperon last year, which more or less confirmed that MH370 did indeed end up in the Indian Ocean, the NOKs know nothing else about the fate of the passengers. One clear theme of this year's memorial was for the search to go on, even after the current 120,000 sq km zone has been fully surveyed, probably by the end of June. At the moment there are no plans to continue the operation being run out of western Australia by the Dutch company Fugro, using state-of-the-art deep-sea sonar vehicles. The zone was chosen in 2014 based on modelling from the seven \"handshakes\" MH370 made automatically with a satellite every hour - the only contact with the plane after all other communications were shut down. It was based on the assumption that the Boeing 777 ran out of fuel, and plunged into the sea. One alternative interpretation is that the pilot managed to glide the plane down gradually into the sea, taking it much further. But that would expand the search zone to three times the size of the existing one, which has already taken almost two years to survey. The families, though, believe that should not stop them from trying. \"I definitely don't want the search to end\", says Grace Nathan, whose mother Anne Daisy was on the flight. \"It's a very harrowing thought for me and the next-of-kin. \"I understand from a logical standpoint what they are saying, that the funds are dwindling, that they've looked very thoroughly in this space, but for me it is very important to find the plane - not just for our own emotional reasons and our need for closure, but I believe the flying public also needs to know what happened.\" MH370 relatives prepare for long fights This month, the families have had to deal with a more immediate task - meeting the deadline imposed by international aviation regulations to file lawsuits against Malaysia Airlines and other parties. Those who have not filed suits by the two-year anniversary lose the right to do so, and must accept whatever compensation the airline offers. This has been another emotional ordeal for them, says lawyer Arunan Selvaraj, who is representing 15 families. \"The whole thing is very traumatic. They are not sure whether they should have a funeral, whether they should move on. And now, because of the limitation period, everyone is under pressure to file their suits. But they find it very difficult to accept that they are claiming money when they don't even have answers to whether the person is alive or dead.\" There has been a flurry of lawsuits filed in the past few days at the High Court in Kuala Lumpur, not just against the airline, but also against the government, the Malaysian aviation authority and the air force. Anyone, in fact, who might have played a role in allowing MH370 to vanish. It is hard to keep track of all the lawsuits, as some are filed on behalf of several relatives of a single passenger. The administrator in charge of the airline's old parent company, Malaysia Airline Systems, who left after it was restructured, says a total of 119 suits filed in Malaysia have been approved. Some may since have been dropped as plaintiffs accepted out-of-court settlements. Relatives have also filed lawsuits in Australia, the US and China. There are some complex variables in all these cases. The 1999 Montreal Convention, which governs liabilities for international aviation, requires an airline to pay out around $160,000 per passenger after a fatal accident regardless of fault. It also places the burden of proof on the airline, which must show in court it was not negligent. In the absence of any evidence of what happened to flight MH370, lawyers say it is all but certain that Malaysia Airlines will be found liable. But the Montreal Convention restricts claimants to filing lawsuits either in the country they are resident, the home country of the airline, or the final destination on their ticket. So very few are eligible to file in this case in the USA, where awards of damages are likely to be much higher than in Malaysia or China. The claimants can file in the US against the aircraft manufacturer, Boeing, and some have tried to do that. But unlike the airline, here the burden of proof lies with the plaintiffs. Again, without any evidence, proving the plane was at fault is next to impossible. There are other uncertainties. The newly restructured Malaysia Airlines insists it has no liability for compensation. And a law passed after the company was renamed last year places limits on claims related to MH370, against it or the old parent company. The airline has repeatedly promised it can and will meet all its legal obligations, but this may be restricted to what its insurance policy covers. After two years of often poor and insensitive communication, there is a widely-felt lack of confidence in how the Malaysian authorities have been dealing with the next-of-kin. \"Sadly the authorities have completely lost the trust of not just the families, but the public at large,\" says KS Narendran, whose wife Chandrika was on board flight MH370. \"I don't know if they have done enough to restore a modicum of trust.\"", "question": "The memorial the families of those on board flight MH370 organised in Kuala Lumpur for the second anniversary of the plane 's disappearance was held in the same place as the first : an open square , with a concert stage , @placeholder in the middle of one of the dozens of featureless shopping malls which act as public spaces in so much of South East Asia .", "option_0": "writes", "option_1": "sitting", "option_2": "resulting", "option_3": "culminated", "option_4": "built", "label": 4}
{"article": "Indeed, Willie Rennie apologised for being insufficiently expansive when encountering Nicola Sturgeon a day or so ago in Glasgow.  Apparently, they exchanged relatively cheery waves (think Brief Encounter, Govan style). But not, at that point, the customary January salutations. This Mr Rennie swiftly remedied. As did the FM. For a moment, it was like a rerun of BBC Scotland's splendid Hogmanay show. But without the Bay City Rollers, or Jackie Bird. Equally, however, there are limits. The seasonal bonhomie is evaporating and that right speedily. As well as being New, this year is electoral. Scotland goes to the polls in May (and also perhaps later in the year for the EU Referendum). So rival policies and competing strategies were to the fore in the exchanges during the debate which dominated today's proceedings in the chamber. The ostensible topic was how Scotland might reasonably go on Supporting Public Services, Tackling Inequality and Growing the Economy.  The real topic, of course, was that election in May. Welcome to the Holyrood Hustings. The individual policy offers were intriguing in themselves. For example, Labour promised to top up the bonus payable to potential first time home buyers by chucking an extra ??3000 into the pot already established by the UK Government. However, it is the strategy - the positioning - which is perhaps most interesting. Instead of defaulting to the proletarian Left, as some might expect in these Corbynite days, Labour's first big offer in Scotland is to back house purchases for those who are already saving. This policy replaces the offer to compensate those in Scotland who were set to lose cash from the early abolition of tax credits by the Chancellor. On the face of it, a recalibration - from supporting the poorest to backing those seeking to rise up the property ladder. But caveats.  Firstly, the tax credit offer spread far more widely than the lowest income decile. That, indeed, was one reason advanced by the Chancellor for reviewing the credits system in the first place. Secondly, Kezia Dugdale insists that helping young families to get their own home is fully in keeping with Labour values. It was, she argued, both anti-austerity and aspirational. Still, the offer attracted attention and derision in equal measure from both the SNP and the Tories. The SNP noted other endeavours to help first time buyers - and jibed that Labour were simply pinching a Conservative plan. For their part, the Tories queried the source of funding. Labour say they'd forego a planned SNP cut in Air passenger duty and a planned Tory hike in the starting level for upper rate tax which would also reduce revenue; no new money, say the Tories. Labour, I suspect, will be entertained by the degree of political contumely which their plan has drawn. As Alex Salmond is fond of saying, \"the mair they talk, I'm kent the better.\" Further, despite the individual policy, Ms Dugdale's wider strategy in her two speeches today (one at Edinburgh University, one in the chamber) was to suggest that the SNP talk Left but walk Right. Indeed, she even borrowed the phrase \"Tartan Tories\". I expect Nicola Sturgeon experienced a warm glow on seeing that one resurrected. Her essential argument was that the SNP simply sought to manage the status quo - without generating the radical change which she said was essential. Ms Sturgeon's party, of course, start this election period with an apparently commanding lead in the polls.  She stressed however that she would not take a single vote for granted. Sensible - and in keeping with her generally cautious demeanour. The SNP's pitch, she said, would be based upon \"record, ideas and vision.\" After a litany of proclaimed successes for her government, she promised further reform: integrating health and social care, doubling childcare, building economic growth through enterprise and exports. Stand by also for announcements on tax plans: not for the immediate future. John Swinney has already said he won't use the Calman tax plans which take effect from April (with no capacity to distinguish between standard and upper rates). No, Ms Sturgeon is talking about the potential use of the Smith tax plans as set out in the current Scotland Bill.  It will be intriguing to see the various parties deal with that dose of forward thinking: to witness how they balance equity with protecting services and with fostering business and personal reward. She is talking too about local taxation. I expect that the Scottish Government will publish plans for a fairly substantial reform of council taxation, allied to partial assignment of income tax receipts to local authorities. She is talking too about welfare.  Again, all parties will have to set out their thoughts as to how they might use pending new powers over benefits. The Conservative policy offer today was on education:  primarily new powers for head teachers over budgets, recruitment and attainment. But, again, it is their wider strategy which is intriguing.  They say they want to offer a credible alternative to the SNP. Does that mean that Ruth Davidson hopes to enter Bute House, as First Minister? Well, if the voters so will??? In practice, though, the Tory aim for May is not to replace the existing Scottish Government but to supplant Labour as the principal Opposition party at Holyrood.  Ms Davidson said she was positing an option to the SNP - then proceeded to devote most of her time to attacking Labour as feckless. Willie Rennie said he wanted to offer a \"bright, liberal, green\" programme for Scotland.  I expect Mr Rennie had hoped to occupy the centre ground, should Labour and the Tories be prepared to desert it, to Left and Right. That seems, in Scotland at least, rather less than likely.  Still, Mr Rennie is adamant that his band of five Holyrood Parliamentarians have achieved far more in terms of effective scrutiny than might be thought numerically proportionate. How much more, he mused, could they do with greater representation after May? And the Greens? They want to overtake the Lib Dems by promoting environmental concerns and querying GDP growth as the quintessential target. Patrick Harvie made an interesting point (actually, he made several, but one will do for now). Yes, he said, the new system of local taxation had to be fair and progressive. Politicians favour words like those because they tend not to frighten the voters. But, he said, the system also had to raise sufficient revenue to fund the improved services promised by various political leaders at Holyrood.  That means, bluntly, some folk paying more in tax. Not sure even a Hogmanay hug will dull the pain of that moment for those who are affected. Folk tend to welcome taxes being levied upon their neighbours. But then that's politics. And those are the choices which will soon be set before us.", "question": "They mean it , you know .

{"article": "Hundreds of fans had queued outside London's Prince of Wales theatre on Monday to see the first UK performance. The Book of Mormon, which lampoons religion and musicals, has already been a huge Broadway hit. To deafening cheers, Parker said: \"It's very cool to be here for the fan performance.\" He added: \"We heard that a lot of you lined up overnight for tickets... and we want to say from the bottom of our hearts, you're... crazy. We don't know that any show can live up to that.\" By Will GompertzArts editor The Book of Mormon's reputation is built on its biting satire, crude humour and the mocking of Mormonism. There is plenty of all three. But having now seen the show twice, I suspect that at least some of its success is down to its rather conservative nature. Strip away all the vulgarities and what you are left with is a traditionally structured, feel-good musical, which is chock-full of catchy show tunes. The Book of Mormon follows the story of two missionaries who are sent from Salt Lake City to preach in a remote Ugandan village. Written by Stone, Parker and Avenue Q's co-creator Robert Lopez, the show is directed by Parker and Casey Nicholaw. The Broadway show won nine Tony awards last year. It recouped its $11.4m (Â£7.3m) investment in nine months, making its money back in part by charging up to $477 (Â£304) for tickets. The West End show is sold out until the end of July, with a small number of daily tickets available via a lottery system. The show's content is not for the faint-hearted, with strong language and jokes about religion, Aids and female circumcision. \"We never sit down and say how can we shock,\" Parker told the BBC Radio 4's Today programme.  \"It is unconventional material for a musical. That's the sort of stuff that we love.\" Stone added: \"It's about two white Mormon boys who grew up in Utah and are sent to a place with Old Testament problems - and nothing they've been taught helps them at all with these problems.\" Elder Clifford Herbertson, a senior spokesman for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (the official name of the Mormon Church), said he thought the musical would raise awareness of the church in the UK. \"I think the important point is that it's entertainment, it's not education, so it will raise awareness but I don't think it will necessarily help people's understanding or appreciation of the church,\" he told the BBC. Scott Brown, New York Magazine's theatre critic, described The Book of Mormon as a \"wacky, irreverent tale\". \"It's one of those revitalising successes,\" he told BBC 5 live Breakfast. \"Broadway is like the pharmaceutical business - they crank out all these drugs, but there is just one that carries the rest of the market for a huge amount of time, and this was Broadway's Viagra for a while.\" Londoner Christina Tencheva was among those who queued for hours on Monday for a reduced-price ticket to the first performance. \"It was outrageous in the best way possible,\" she said after the show. \"I knew it was going to be rude in places but I came in with an open mind. I think anyone can enjoy it as long as you leave any prejudice at the door.\" Anna Koscheck, a regular West End theatre-goer, noted the show's youthful audience.  \"I pointed out to my friend when we went in that everyone is so young.  I don't think I've ever seen that before.\" Matt Stone and Trey Parker met at the University of Colorado and as students created the indie film Cannibal! The Musical.

{"article": "Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Enda Kenny's language sounded more diplomatic than that of former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern. Mr Ahern told the BBC any British exit from the EU would be \"senseless\" and set Northern Ireland back \"light years\". But given the close trading, social and cultural relations between Britain and Ireland, it is obvious any taoiseach will be worried about what would be a far reaching change to the status quo. This week, a report from an Irish parliamentary committee spelled out Dublin's concerns in more detail. The Oireachtas (Irish Parliament) Joint Committee on European Union Affairs wants the Irish government to be \"involved from the outset in all negotiations on the UK relationship with the EU, as UK's membership of the EU is an issue of vital national interest to Ireland\". When it comes to Northern Ireland the committee argues that - in the context of the Good Friday Agreement - \"the Irish Government has a voice in relation to the future of Northern Ireland and must feature in EU negotiations with the UK\". In the event of a British withdrawal from the EU, the committee wants London and Dublin to make arrangements to replace any lost EU funding. Perhaps even more difficult to achieve, the committee wants the Irish and UK Governments to negotiate \"to have Northern Ireland recognised (in an EU context) as having 'a special position' in the UK, in view of the Good Friday Agreement\".  It also recommends that \"special arrangements be negotiated at EU level in that context, to maintain North-South relations and Northern Irish EU citizenship rights\". Boiling that down, I assume the idea is that if someone is living in Northern Ireland, but carrying an Irish passport, they should continue to enjoy the benefits of EU membership, even if the UK has pulled out. Some unionists are not impressed by the Irish Parliamentary Committee's intervention. Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MEP Diane Dodds regards the committee's view that Dublin must play a role in Mr Cameron's renegotiation as \"unwelcome interference in the affairs of the UK\". Should Britain leave the EU, there is no doubt there will be practical consequences so far as the UK's only land border is concerned. But will it, as the Irish committee fears, \"result in issues around freedom of movement in border areas, border controls and customs checking\"? On security grounds alone, it seems unlikely that a new network of fixed customs posts and immigration offices will be erected between Newry and Dundalk or Londonderry and Donegal. Indeed, as the Irish Parliamentary Committee itself points out, arrangements like the British Irish \"Common Travel Area\" which allows the free movement of people pre-date UK or Irish membership of the EU, as does the special status of Irish people living in the UK as \"non-foreign aliens\" (a term I hadn't been aware of until reading the committee's report). However, it is hard to argue with the committee's contention that \"should the UK leave the EU, then the Northern Ireland border would become significant as it would become an external EU border\". \"This would raise considerable challenges for the open borders policy between the UK and Ireland,\" the committee's report added. If a UK outside the EU sought to tighten immigration controls at Dover and Heathrow, could it completely ignore a porous land border with a neighbouring EU state? Back in the days of Tony Blair's ill fated \"e-borders\" initiative, unionists objected to the idea they might be asked to show passports when travelling on flights or ferries between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.

The four have been charged with hate crimes and aggravated kidnapping and battery, among other things. An online fundraiser for their victim has collected $51,000 (Â£42,500) so far. Denying the four suspects bail, Judge Maria Kuriakos Ciesil asked: \"Where was your sense of decency?\" Prosecutors told the court the beating started in a van and continued at a house, where the suspects allegedly forced the 18-year-old white victim, who suffers from schizophrenia and attention deficit disorder, to drink toilet water and kiss the floor. Police allege the van was earlier stolen by Mr Hill, who is also accused of demanding $300 from the victim's mother while they held him captive, according to the Chicago Tribune. The court was also told the suspects stuffed a sock into his mouth, taped his mouth shut and bound his hands with a belt. In a video made for Facebook Live which was watched millions of times, the assailants can be heard making derogatory statements against white people and Donald Trump. The victim had been dropped off at a McDonalds to meet Mr Hill - who was one of his friends - on 31 December. He was found by a police officer on Tuesday, 3 January, a day after he was reported missing by his parents.

{"article": "As perhaps Donald Trump's closest political adviser, he was accused by Senator Ted Cruz during the primary campaign of having half a century of trickery behind him, and being the master of the smear. Mr Stone responded by calling the senator a liar and comparing him to Richard Nixon, always a low blow. And he should know. He learned his trade as a political fixer in the Nixon White House, where, he's happy to admit, he was part of the rough political generation of the Watergate era. He is smooth, soft spoken and funny, and relaxed in a white suit and the kind of brown and white shoes that a Gatsby might have worn. But he's as tough as they come. We spoke in Cleveland about Mr Trump, his friend for nearly 40 years. He acknowledges the candidate's penchant for shooting from the hip, his egocentricity, and his unpredictability. So why was he fit to be president? \"He's smart - don't forget that - and he listens, probably more than you think.\" I asked him how we might picture him, as president, sitting down in Russian President Vladimir Putin's office. \"Putin will respect him more than he respects Obama. I'll tell you that. They have a lot in common.\" Then, we talk about the Republican Party. The party of the Bushes - no-one from that clan has come to this convention - is, to Mr Stone, a thing of the past that is gone for ever. \"Trump is the outsider who has changed everything. This is like nothing we have seen before. The times have changed completely.\" He's too long in the tooth to predict the course of the campaign - which he thinks lies 50/50 as things stand - but he will admit something that the grizzled veterans of the circuit know for a fact but sometimes try to put out of their minds: this will be the \"dirtiest, most bruising\" campaign of them all. So I asked whether he, and the others who brought us campaigns dominated by attack ads, felt regret. Hadn't the public discourse been poisoned by all this? Not at all, says Mr Stone. Remember that when Abraham Lincoln was running for election in 1860, there was a leaflet campaign against him in Illinois based on the rumour that he'd fathered a mixed-race child. Take from that what you will. It's clear that this will be a brutal piece of hand-to-hand combat. The Republican message, hammered out every evening at the convention this week like a drum beat, is that Hillary Clinton - the secretary of state who set up her own email server - should be made to pay. \"Hillary - prison 2016,\" say the placards. Mr Stone hardly needs to be tempted to launch into vitriolic attacks on the Clintons, for whom he has a special loathing. Their charitable foundation, for example, is to him \"organised crime\". This is politics in the raw. And with Mr Stone at the heart of the Trump campaign, it's obvious that although the candidate's tone may change a a little - Mr Stone reminds me never to forget that Mr Trump has never done this before, at any level - he will end as he began, as a street-fighter. We'll see that, especially, in the three debates scheduled for later September and October. But I put it to Mr Stone that Mrs Clinton is a lawyer with a razor-sharp mind who will be ready for anything Mr Trump throws at her. His response is that she'll find it hard to deal with someone who is as happy to break the rules as Mr Trump. \"He'll say things that no-one else would say.\" And he makes a surprising observation about the woman for whom so many Republicans have developed a dislike that sometimes feels like an obsession. \"I think she has a glass jaw.\" In the boxing ring - it's Mr Trump's favourite sport - that's fatal for a fighter. Mr Stone thinks she will find it hard to match the most unorthodox bruiser she has ever had to tangle with. On the other side, they disagree. For the Clinton team, the debates are a happy prospect. They think it will be Mr Trump who ends up on the floor. We shall see. But with Roger Stone in his corner, we can say one thing. This campaign, noisy and even raucous as it has already become, is going to be bloody.

{"article": "Boron nitride, or \"white graphene\", is similar to its namesake: sheets of atoms laid out like a chain-link fence. A report in Nature Communications shows the material can preferentially soak up organic pollutants such as industrial chemicals or engine oil. However, it is easier to clean and re-use than other such \"nanomaterials\". The family of these materials includes much-touted, carbon-based members such as graphene and nanotubes, and are notable in part for their surface area-to-weight ratio. That allows them to take up an incredible amount for their size, making them attractive for the clean-up of pollutants. The new work suggests that a preparation of boron nitride could outperform many nanomaterials and more traditional approaches. A team from the Institute for Frontier Materials at Deakin University in Australia and the Pierre and Marie Curie University in France started by making porous boron nitride \"nanosheets\" - wavy, single-atom layers of the material with holes in them. These porous sheets, which together form a coarse white powder, vastly outperformed sheets that did not have the pores, and commercially available chunks of boron nitride that is not made up of the tiny sheets. The porous version exhibited high \"selective absorption and adsorption\" - preferentially picking up organic pollutants and dyes out of water. The powder soaked up as much as 33 times its own weight in the chemical ethylene glycol and 29 times its own weight of engine oil. Even still, the saturated powder floats on water. The pollutants could then be driven out of the nooks and crannies of the material by heating it in a commercial furnace, or by simply igniting it - a trick that other, more established materials could only survive a few times before becoming completely clogged up. \"All these features make these porous nanosheets suitable for a wide range of applications in water purification and treatment,\" the authors wrote. Francesco Stellacci of EPFL in Switzerland called the work \"an excellent paper in a booming field\". \"The data reported are indeed excellent and impressive,\" he told BBC News. \"The key question is if this is the material that at the end will be used for remediation.\" Prof Stellacci said that a market for such materials does not yet exist, and boron nitride's striking clean-up powers may or may not be enough to establish it as a leading contender, even among nanomaterials. \"I think that at the end it will not be performance that will determine the final material used, but more costs and scalability.

{"article": "In two of the EU's biggest countries - France and the UK - anti-EU, anti-immigration parties came top. And in struggling Greece it was a Eurosceptic party of the left - Syriza - which won. Yet overall the pro-EU parties remained the dominant players. Here are 10 highlights of the elections, in which millions of Europe's voters protested against their leaders - or simply did not bother to vote. For the first time the far-right National Front (FN) won a French national election. It will send 24 MEPs to Brussels - compared with just three elected in 2009. A triumphant Marine Le Pen said she would fight \"crazy measures like votes for immigrants\". Her party trounced the ruling Socialists of President Francois Hollande, beaten into third place. It was a painful blow for the unpopular president, as France has always been at the heart of the European project. Mr Hollande said it was a \"problem\" not only for France but for Europe as a whole - a problem which had \"tarnished the image of France\". German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble deplored the result, labelling the FN \"fascist\". In the UK, Nigel Farage's anti-EU UK Independence Party (UKIP) pulled off a similar triumph. \"The UKIP fox is in the Westminster henhouse,\" Mr Farage said, after making political history by breaking the Conservative-Labour duopoly in a national election. Like the FN, UKIP boosted its tally of MEPs to 24. But it is not yet clear who its new allies will be in the European Parliament - Mr Farage has ruled out any deal with Ms Le Pen. UKIP now has its sights on Westminster - though the British \"first-past-the-post\" electoral system makes it a lot harder for small parties to win seats. UKIP is campaigning for a British exit from the EU, and calls for tough curbs on immigration. The anti-EU trend was not repeated in the Netherlands, despite predictions that the Freedom Party (PVV) of Geert Wilders was poised to do well. The anti-immigration, anti-Islam PVV won just three seats and fell to fourth place - well behind liberal and centre-left, pro-EU parties. Before the election the PVV and Ms Le Pen's FN vowed to team up in a new Eurosceptic bloc, but such an alliance has been much weakened by the Dutch result. In solidly pro-EU Germany a new anti-euro party, Alternative for Germany (AfD), made its mark, winning seven seats. It is now in the 67-strong non-aligned bloc called \"Others\" in the new parliament - independent parties which campaigned on a host of different issues. AfD is not anti-EU but believes the euro is fundamentally flawed and says German taxpayers must not pay the bills for reckless governments or banks in other EU countries. Another surprise in the German election was that a neo-Nazi politician, Udo Voigt, was elected, for the National Democratic Party (NPD). For years there has been heated debate in Germany about banning the NPD, but many fear that a ban would only drive the membership underground. In Greece the new ultra-nationalist Golden Dawn party - often described as \"neo-Nazis\" too - won three seats. The party, whose leaders are under criminal investigation, came third. Uniforms and fascist-era emblems are also a feature of Jobbik in Hungary, which won three seats. A common feature of the parties is their hostility towards immigrants. In some cases party activists have been involved in racist attacks. Italy had a relatively high turnout - 60% - and voters gave strong backing to the new prime minister Matteo Renzi, leader of the centre-left Democratic Party (PD). Many were surprised by the scale of his win. His rise in national politics has been meteoric - not long ago he was mayor of Florence, and did not even have a seat in parliament. Mr Renzi's PD came well ahead of the anti-establishment, Eurosceptic Five Star Movement of Beppe Grillo, and the right-wing Forza Italia party of former PM Silvio Berlusconi. It was an encouraging sign for pro-EU leaders who hope that Mr Renzi's reforms can revive the ailing Italian economy. In Greece and Spain there were impressive results for new radical left Eurosceptic parties. The Syriza party led by Alexis Tsipras won in Greece with 26.6%. He also led the European Left bloc, condemning the EU/IMF bailout conditions for Greece as \"catastrophic\". He wants new national elections and a full renegotiation of the Greek bailout. The rise of radical left parties in Spain also disrupted the traditional political order there. Spain's two dominant parties - of centre-left and centre-right - dropped below 50% of the vote, in a historic result. The new Podemos party, born of the indignados protest movement, surged into fourth place,  just behind the former communists. On results night at the European Parliament there was a solemn announcement before the official results came in: the \"inevitable\" decline in turnout had been reversed. By how much? Well, 0.1%. So this time overall turnout was 43.1%. But as the dust settled the overall picture was not encouraging. Yes, turnout was very high in countries where voting is compulsory, such as Belgium, Luxembourg and Malta. But turnout was very low in much of Eastern Europe - Slovakia was lowest, with just 13%. And in Poland, where EU membership is very popular, it was just 23%. East European countries are net recipients from the EU budget - yet their people appear disengaged from EU politics. A new German word entered the EU vocabulary in this election: \"Spitzenkandidaten\". It refers to the lead candidates of the party blocs in the parliament, vying to become the next EU Commission president. For the first time in a European election these party rivals held live TV debates about EU policy, presenting their platforms to millions of voters across Europe. It was an effort to bring the EU closer to ordinary people - but also an exercise in power politics. European Parliament leaders were showing that they would not let EU governments impose a Commission president on them. Under the Lisbon Treaty, the governments have to \"take account\" of the election result when they choose the EU's most powerful bureaucrat. In theory that gives the voters some influence, albeit indirectly. The centre-right European People's Party (EPP) won overall, despite losing more than 60 seats. But it is not clear whether the EPP 's candidate Jean-Claude Juncker, a veteran of EU politics, will succeed in his bid to become next Commission president. An EU leaders' summit on 27 May marked the start of hard bargaining over the top Commission job and his or her new team, who will draft EU laws in Brussels. A name should be finalised by the end of June - but then the whole Commission still has to get approval from the new parliament. That process will not be complete until October at the earliest. Some EU leaders - notably the UK's David Cameron and Hungary's Viktor Orban - are likely to oppose Mr Juncker's bid.

{"article": "The German online newspaper Spiegel described it as \"the most honest government statement\", because Mrs Merkel's frustration was obvious. \"We are in an extraordinary situation,\" she said. The chancellor has been under pressure for weeks after her decision to temporarily suspend the Dublin protocol to allow thousands of migrants to travel from Budapest into Germany. Since then a record number of people have arrived here; government figures reveal at least 164,000 refugees and migrants entered Germany in September alone. \"I didn't create this,\" Mrs Merkel said. \"I had to react and change an extraordinary situation into a controlled situation but we have to deal with it now.\" It's tempting to wonder whether the chancellor is losing control. She continues to defiantly defend her open-door refugee policy. It has won her international plaudits but it's causing consternation at home. Her approval ratings are sliding, a growing number of Germans are turning out to anti-refugee demonstrations (last night 8,000 people supported a demonstration organised by the populist party Alternative for Germany, AfD) and political pressure is growing. Thirty-four of her own conservative local party leaders have written to her, accusing her of pursuing a policy that is nether part of her party's programme or in line with German and European law. It's time, they say, for Germany to start turning people away at the border. They've provoked a rather irritable response. \"We can't close the borders,\" Mrs Merkel said. \"We carry out checks there but there are 3,000 kilometres of border - do you want to erect a fence all the way along it? People will still find ways to come; there is no stop to the influx. \"I think about it all day, I think what are the possibilities. We can protect the outer European border better but even that won't stop people from coming.\" If anything, Mrs Merkel is pursuing her policy more single-mindedly than ever before. In fact - in a move which effectively sidelines her Interior Minister, Thomas de Maiziere - she has just brought day-to-day control of the refugee crisis under her own roof. The chancellery and her chief-of-staff, Peter Altmaier, will now manage the situation. Increasingly, it seems like a personal crusade. She claims she's simply exemplifying the Christian values of the CDU. But her language is emotional: \"I'm proud that we are receiving refugees in a friendly and open manner. I don't want to compete to be the country which does best at scaring off refugees.\" The chancellor had of course hoped for more support from her European neighbours. Nevertheless, she's pledged to keep chipping away at reluctant EU member states to create longer-term solutions. She's taken flak for her willingness to work with Turkey. \"It's my damned duty,\" she snapped in response. But while it's tempting to see the chancellor as an isolated figure, hell-bent on an unpopular policy which will bring down her chancellorship, it's worth noting that (perhaps now with the exception of Mr de Maiziere), her cabinet is solidly behind her. Only a handful of senior MPs have broken rank to publicly criticise her. There is no serious pretender to her crown. In every affected German town and city, thousands of people are volunteering their time, money and possessions to help the refugees.

{"article": "The two candidates clashed over a claim that hackers tied to the Russian state were trying to influence the election. Two days earlier, on Friday, the US director of national intelligence had pointed the finger at the highest levels of the Russian state for intrusions. Critics of Russia have argued that any role would be part of a growing trend of not just stealing information but also weaponising it. The story begins in May, when the Democratic National Committee (DNC) became concerned about suspicious behaviour on its computer network. It called in the security firm CrowdStrike to take a look. Two hacker groups were found on the system, one that had just entered and another that had been there for nearly a year. \"We recognised that there was an adversary in their environment that had targeted that network and was looking at communicationsâ€¦. and research on opposition candidates,\" Shawn Henry, chief security officer at Crowdstrike and a former executive assistant director of the FBI, tells the BBC. \"We did attribution back to the Russian government. \"In this particular case we believed it was the Russian government involved in an espionage campaign - essentially collecting intelligence against candidates for the US presidency.\" But after the DNC and Crowdstrike went public in pointing the finger, material was released into the public domain, shifting the focus from traditional espionage - theft of data - to something more like an influence operation designed to have an impact in the real world. This is part of a wider trend of Russian activity that Western officials have been watching with alarm for some time. \"We are seeing a more open and aggressive use of cyber, so that the information becomes a weapon and a weapon of influence,\" Sir David Omand, a former director of Britain's GCHQ, tells the BBC. On Friday, the US director of national intelligence went public over these concerns. \"These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process,\" James Clapper said in a joint statement with the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. \"Such activity is not new to Moscow - the Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia, for example, to influence public opinion there. \"We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia's most senior officials could have authorised these activities.\" The Kremlin has rejected the accusations, describing them as \"nonsense\". One additional concern is that information might be manipulated before it is leaked. In other words, false information could be planted amongst a dump of real data which will be picked up and reported on before people have a chance to verify it. A number of US states have also reported scanning and probing of election related systems - such as voter databases. US intelligence said this may have originated from servers operated by a Russian company but it said it was not in a position to attribute this activity to the Russian government. It also said that it would be difficult for anyone to actually alter ballot counts because of the decentralised nature of the system and protections in place. But even the attempt and the possibility of intrusion may be enough to cause problems when it comes to public perception around election time. \"The only reason I can see why you would want to do that is to sow doubt about the outcome of the election,\" Sir David Omand says of the activity. \"Because if you are in a district where you have to rely on the voting machines and you know the voting machines [and] the database has been penetrated can you really trust the result? \"You will very quickly get rumours after the election that the result in some areas could be in doubt. \"I can see plausible reasons why - at the moment - Russia would be quite happy to see the United States inconvenienced in that way.\" Russia has pioneered techniques of hybrid warfare and information operations in recent years including in conflicts in Ukraine and Georgia. Russian intelligence also has a long history of \"active measures\" and \"influence operations\" going back to the Cold War. But cyberspace offers a new means for pursuing this agenda and on a transformative scale. With discussion about how the US should respond, the trend worries some experts. \"At the nation state level there needs to be diplomatic discussion about what is acceptable and what is not,\" argues Mr Henry. \"Or we will see an increasing arms race in this space. \"And that doesn't work out for anybody.\"", "question": "Amidst all the heat of the presidential debate on Sunday night , hackers @placeholder for a brief moment .", "option_0": "called", "option_1": "thought", "option_2": "surfaced", "option_3": "disappeared", "option_4": "following", "label": 2}
{"article": "Carter was part of the Jamaican quartet that won the 4x100m in Beijing in 2008. His was one of 454 selected doping samples retested by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) last year, and has been found to contain the banned stimulant methylhexaneamine. Bolt, 30, completed an unprecedented 'triple triple' in Rio last summer. He won gold in the 100m, 200m and 4x100m relay to add to his successes in the same events in 2008 and 2012. Carter, 31, was also part of the squad that won the event in London five years ago and helped Jamaica win at the World Championships in 2011, 2013 and 2015. He ran the first leg for Jamaica's 4x100m relay team in Beijing, which also included Michael Frater, Asafa Powell and Bolt. The team won in a then-world record of 37.10 seconds, ahead of Trinidad and Tobago and Japan, who could have their medals upgraded. Brazil would then receive bronze. Russia's Tatiana Lebedeva has also been stripped of her Beijing long jump and triple jump silver medals after dehydrochlormethyltestosterone was found in one of her samples. Carter was tested on the evening of the Beijing final in 2008 but that was found at the time to contain no \"adverse analytical finding\". More than 4,500 tests were carried out at those Games, with nine athletes caught cheating. An anomaly was discovered in Carter's submission following the IOC's decision to retest 454 samples from Beijing using the latest scientific analysis methods. Carter and the Jamaican National Olympic Committee were told of the adverse finding in May - before the Rio Games - and told his B sample would be tested. It was reported by Reuters in June that Carter's A sample had been found to contain methylhexanamine, which has been on the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) prohibited list since 2004. It was reclassified in 2011 as a \"specified substance\", meaning one that is more susceptible to a \"credible, non-doping explanation\". Sold as a nasal decongestant in the United States until 1983, methylhexanamine has been used more recently as an ingredient in dietary supplements. Speaking in June, Bolt said the prospect of having to return the gold was \"heartbreaking\".

{"article": "Pakistan is increasingly finding itself friendless in the region as Iran, Afghanistan and India all find fault with Pakistan's inability to end terrorism on its soil and in particular to bring the Afghan Taliban to the table for peace talks, as Islamabad promised to do nearly two years ago. The 48-nation NSG, which sets global rules for international trade in nuclear energy technology, has become the latest diplomatic battleground between India and Pakistan. It is due to hold a crucial meeting this month. The Pakistani military is angry that after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent trip to Washington, the US has been furiously lobbying all member countries to give India a seat at the NSG table. Pakistan then asked for the same, but its proliferation record is not as good as India's and it clearly would not succeed. Instead, it has asked China to veto the Indian bid which it is likely to do. However, smaller countries are angry with the US, who they accuse of browbeating them, and complain that neither India nor Pakistan can become members until they sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT) which is an essential requirement. President Obama backs Indian entry to nuclear technology Pariah to friend: Narendra Modi and the US come full circle President Obama is going against his own policy of nuclear restraint and disarmament by offering to make India - but not Pakistan - a member of the NSG, when the US has also tied up plans to sell India six nuclear power plants. At the same time the US has shown in several dramatic steps that it is deeply unsatisfied with Pakistan's efforts to stop the Afghan Taliban operating out of Pakistan. Last month it used a drone in Balochistan province to kill Mullah Akthar Mansour, the Taliban leader, which led to Pakistan accusing the US of violating its sovereignty. The US then publicly accused Pakistan of not doing enough to stop the Taliban and the Haqqani militant group - and in a clear signal of support to the beleaguered Afghan government, President Obama has allowed remaining US forces in Afghanistan to fight alongside Afghan forces. Finally, during Mr Modi's trip the US publicly condemned those extremist groups operating out of Pakistani Punjab and Kashmir whose activities Islamabad has not stopped. In what was seen as a clear snub and a signal of defiance to the US and India, the military allowed Hafiz Saeed, the leader of Lashkar-e-Taiba who is wanted for the Mumbai bombings in 2008, to lead prayers last Friday in Islamabad. The military's fear is that it believes the US is withdrawing from South Asia and will leave behind its rival India as the regional policeman - something it cannot tolerate. The military has already accused Iran and Afghanistan of hosting Indian spies which are working to undermine Pakistan and in particular sabotage the One Road One Belt route and transportation network that China has promised to build from the Gulf port of Gwadar to China. Pakistan's relations with Afghanistan are as bad as they have been for years, and not much better with Iran. After waiting for more than a year Afghan President Ashraf Ghani has now washed his hands of trying to persuade Pakistan to get the Taliban to hold talks with Kabul. His frustration has clearly been supported now by the Americans. Meanwhile, with sanctions against Iran having ended, civilian politicians and the public were looking forward to the quick building of an Iranian oil and gas pipeline that would give Pakistan desperately needed energy and electricity. However after Islamabad accused Iran of hosting Indians trying to sabotage Pakistan's economy, Iran is now nursing its pride. China remains Pakistan's closest ally but China, too, is becoming frustrated. It plans to build a $45bn transportation and energy link up to its grand Silk Route project through Central Asia, but it wants the military to use its political influence to first end the Taliban-led war in Afghanistan and the insurgency in Balochistan province. The chronic state of Pakistan's foreign policy has affected domestic politics. Part of the problem is that there is little input from the civilian government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif or the foreign ministry or parliament into making policy - that has become the domain of the military. Mr Sharif has wanted to improve ties with India, Iran and the US but he has been unable to do so. Meanwhile, opposition politicians have accused Mr Sharif of surrendering all foreign policy decisions to the military. The military in turn are deeply frustrated - and here they have considerable public support - that Mr Sharif has not appointed a foreign minister or improved governance. He has not even given up the portfolio for foreign affairs even as he recovers from open heart surgery in London.

{"article": "Maniac has been restricted to festival film screenings and academic viewing by government officials and will not be eligible for mainstream cinema or DVD release in the country. The film, directed by Frank Khalfoun, stars Wood as serial killer Frank. Neil Foley of distributor Monster Pictures said he was \"flabbergasted\". The director of the Australia-based company said the ban was an \"insult to the intelligence\" of adults in New Zealand. The film, which received a limited UK release in March, is due to screen at the New Zealand International Film Festival in Auckland and Wellington at the end of July. Ant Timpson, a programmer for the festival, said the Office of Film and Literature Classification (OFLC) was concerned that the movie was \"injurious to the public good\". \"It's saying that the POV [point of view] nature of the film mixed with the psychopathic behaviour of actor Elijah Wood is more than disturbing, that it's potentially dangerous in the hands of the wrong person,\" Timpson suggested.

{"article": "The world's second largest economy has never been a football powerhouse, qualifying for just one World Cup. Meanwhile, the population seems more interested in NBA basketball than the sport known in the UK as \"the people's game\". But over the past couple of years Chinese investors and firms have quietly been acquiring stakes in football clubs in England, Spain, France, Netherlands and the Czech Republic, while President Xi Jinping has professed a love of the game. So why are the Chinese now snapping up stakes in European clubs? Reasons include a national desire to look good on the world stage, developing China's club football and national team, creating Chinese football fan bases, and firms using clubs to build their commercial presence in Europe. \"China likes to be omnipotent and successful in everything it does,\" Simon Chadwick, chair in sport business at Coventry University Business School, tells me. \"One thing they currently don't do particularly well at is football, the global game.  China wants to ascend to a position where it is respected globally as part of the international football community.\" He says President Xi has come out as a big football fan, and that by 2025 China wants to have a domestic sports industry worth $850bn (£564bn).  Optimistic estimates put the current entire global sports economy at $400bn. Slavia Prague, one of the most historic names in Czech football, was heavily in debt, and near financial collapse before the start of this season. In September, China Energy Company Limited (CEFC) bought roughly 60% of the club for an undisclosed sum, with Czech businessman Jiri Simane buying around 40%. The CEFC football purchase was part of a bigger investment move by the firm into the Czech Republic. In 2014 it had decided to establish a major European base in Prague, buying two historic properties in the city, and also a number of businesses. Following Slavia's previous woes, CEFC has managed to keep top players like Czech national forward Milan Skoda at the club, and there are plans to buy other top domestic players, much to the approval of fans. Slavia just avoided relegation last season. Now it sits fifth in the table and there is talk of qualifying for next season's Europa League. \"This would be market-making on an unprecedented scale in sport,\" says Prof Chadwick. \"China would then be able to bid for the football World Cup, and the ultimate aim would then be to win it. \"But they need to learn more about football - that is crucial.  With these club purchases, they have been going about acquiring competence.\" Chinese parents traditionally prefer their children to enter a profession rather than sport, says Prof Chadwick, so in order to improve playing standards the country has been building US-style soccer campuses. These enable talented youngsters to improve their football skills, while at the same time also learning and potentially preparing to enter university. Prof Chadwick says in establishing a domestic football league, China has been influenced by Japan's J-League. Before its creation, in 1993, the Japanese national team did not qualify for World Cups, but since 1998 has been in five in a row. CMC/Citic Capital - 13% stake in City Football Group (Man City parent firm) Rastar Group - 56% stake in Spanish club Espanyol Dalian Wanda Group -  20% stake in Spanish club Atletico Madrid CEFC China Energy Company - 60% stake in Czech club Slavia Prague Ledus - complete ownership of French club Sochaux United Vansen International Sports Company - majority shareholder in Dutch club ADO Den Haag This combination of US and Japanese influences, has now been joined by acquiring knowledge from European football clubs. \"Man City is not a random buy,\" says Prof Chadwick. \"They have got the Etihad Campus, which is the model the Chinese want to follow.\" Ownership of European clubs also provides a voice at European confederation Uefa, which can be useful when decisions are made about where to stage future World Cups, he says. Meanwhile, Gu Xin, from Beijing-based sports marketing firm Yutang Sports, says that Chinese investors can also see potentially rich economic returns from European football. He says owning stakes in the likes of Atletico Madrid could potentially open the doors to Chinese players appearing in club first teams in Europe. \"As a result, there could be more Chinese fans of the clubs, which means larger commercial values for the clubs in the Chinese market. \"The companies could [also] then earn money by transferring international players [from the European teams] to Chinese teams. This is another very profitable revenue stream.\" Fans in France were surprised - and rather sceptical - when Hong Kong-listed Ledus bought second division Sochaux from Peugeot for €7m (£5m) in July. Ledus is an electrical components manufacturer specialising in the production of LED-based lighting systems. Sochaux is one of the oldest professional clubs in France, and had always been owned by Peugeot, which founded the team in 1928. For local residents, the club and the firm were a family. French media observers say it is unlikely that Ledus will be able to build a fan base in China around the club, rather that the new owners are using Sochaux as a vehicle to develop the Ledus brand in France and Europe. After a poor start to the season, the club currently sits third from bottom of the second tier, and fans are starting to ask questions about what the Chinese strategy for Sochaux actually is. The Chinese ownership says that Ledus is in Sochaux for the long term, and that the club will achieve its goal of getting back into Ligue 1. Prof Chadwick also says those Chinese businesses that follow the wishes of their national president and support football may be looked upon favourably by the authorities. And there are signs that investment by firms in the Chinese domestic football market is creating progress there. He points to club Guangzhou Evergrande - 60% owned by Evergrande Real Estate and 40% by Jack Ma's Alibaba - which has won the Asian Champions league two times in past three years. \"I think China can win a World Cup,\" he says. \"It has the resources, scale, and and state backing to fast forward 150 years of football development into 10 years.\"", "question": "When Chinese investors recently decided to acquire a 13 % stake in Manchester City 's parent firm , it put the country 's @placeholder interest in football firmly in the spotlight .", "option_0": "major", "option_1": "fleet", "option_2": "renewed", "option_3": "humiliating", "option_4": "race", "label": 2}

{"article": "But what if the child can't get a place because he or she has not been baptised? That is the situation that faces one family in the Republic of Ireland, where the Catholic church controls 90% of schools. Nikki Murphy is sitting in the front-room of her house in Terenure in south Dublin playing with her four-year-old son Reuben. His toy helicopter and trucks are scattered on the floor. She said she has applied without success to 15 local schools - Catholic, Church of Ireland, Methodist and Jewish - for a place for Reuben. Why? Because he is not baptised and not a member of any religion in a state where the churches control 96% of all schools and give preference to their members rather than to local children. She said: \"Parents shouldn't really have to work this hard to get a school place for their child. \"These are state-funded schools, so, we're frustrated and very angry. \"There's a lot of stress, anxiety and sleepless nights.  We're desperate at the moment.\" Nikki knows that the state must offer Reuben a school place, but it could be several miles away. She said that might mean him having to stay overnight with her parents from Monday to Friday, given her and her husband's work commitments and Dublin's traffic. Paddy Monahan's seven-month old son, Cormac, is also unbaptised. And he is also at risk of not getting a local school place. Paddy, a barrister, says it is unconstitutional to discriminate against children like his, and he has 16,000 signatures seeking a change in the law. \"I just want my kid to go to the local school around the corner,\" he said. \"It's 200 metres away and it's a really good school. \"It's paid for by taxpayers.  It doesn't bother me that it's owned by the Catholic Church.  It's paid for by us.  I just think it's good for kids to mix in their local school.\" The Balbriggan Educate Together primary school in north county Dublin does not believe in separating children on the basis of beliefs. Its pupils are of all religions and none. There is a growing demand for places in such schools, which are still relatively small in number, reflecting both a more racially diverse and less religious population. Mary McGrath and her husband, Richard Long, who are both atheists, currently have three children at school there. Richard said: \"From a personal point of view, the less religion they are taught, the happier I am.\" Mary added that they \"liked the multi-denominational ethos where they learn about all religions but where there is no faith formation and the family values of our home are still respected in the school day\". Aoife Leahy, another parent, said that in the Educate Together model \"nobody is made to feel an outsider\". \"Everyone is valued,\" she added. \"I don't think people set out to discriminate. \"But sometimes schools are using policies that are quite old that maybe need to be updated, and society here has changed a lot.\" Society has, indeed, changed. The numbers attending church have fallen sharply, partly as a result of modernisation and partly as a result of the child sex-abuse scandals by priests that were covered-up for decades by the Catholic hierarchy. This year, the Republic of Ireland became the first country in the world to vote for same-sex marriage in a referendum - and by an overwhelming margin. The Balbriggan Educate Together's principal, Dr Fintan McCutcheon, said he wished \"that we didn't have a situation whereby over 95% of our schools represent the sectoral interests of an undemocratic body without any electoral mandate to run those schools\". He said he wished the Irish government \"would address that issue with considerable urgency and expediency\". To meet the growing demand for more non-religious education, the Catholic Church has said it will divest itself of schools but it is not doing so fast enough, according to both its critics and the Archbishop of Dublin, Diarmuid Martin. The Department of Education says schools should, in future, be obliged to take pupils based on proximity or how close they lived to the school, rather than membership of a particular religion. But that will require a change in the law which may not be enacted before the general election expected early next year.

{"article": "It is Monday night and the club is jam-packed. It is clear who the crowd is waiting for: drag queen and stand-up comedian Kumar. The audience cheer as he appears in an emerald-green evening gown and a blonde wig. Kumar wastes no time before cracking his trademark sexually-explicit jokes. \"Girls, you don't need to have sex with Ang mo [Caucasian] men any more. Local boys are good enough in bed. I've tried them out for you,\" he laughs. But strictly speaking he could be jailed for admitting this, because sex between men is a criminal act in Singapore. Under the law, a man caught committing an act of \"gross indecency\" with another man could be jailed for up to two years. It was introduced by British colonial authorities as part of broader legislation which also banned sexual acts such as anal and oral sex. Similar prohibitions also remain in section 377 of the Penal Codes of Malaysia, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Singapore's parliament repealed most of them in 2007, except for one. \"It left behind section 377A so today only same-sex relations between men are singled out for criminalisation,\" says assistant professor Lynette Chua from the Centre for Asian Legal Studies at the National University of Singapore. The speech made in 2007 by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong sums up the reason. \"Singapore is basically a conservative society,\" he said. \"The family is the basic building block of this society. And by family in Singapore we mean one man, one woman, marrying, having children and bringing up children within that framework of a stable family unit.\" The Ministry of Home Affairs said that in 2007 the \"majority of Singaporeans still took a conservative approach to this issue\". \"On issues of moral values with consequences to the wider society... the policies of the government must reflect the mainstream values and social norms of Singapore society, while recognising that these may shift over time,\" it said in an emailed statement. Authorities \"would not take a proactive approach towards enforcing section 377A\", the ministry said, but did not confirm when the last such prosecution took place. A man was charged under 377A in 2010 for engaging in oral sex with another man in a public restroom, but he later pleaded guilty to a different charge of committing an obscene act in public. Nonetheless, there are calls for change. Couple Gary Lim and Kenneth Chee have been seeking to have the law declared unconstitutional. The High Court recently ruled against them but they have decided to appeal. Any male person who, in public or private, commits, or abets the commission of, or procures or attempts to procure the commission by any male person of, any act of gross indecency with another male person, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 2 years. It is in this climate that a new gay magazine has been launched this month by Hiro Mizuhara and Noel Ng. \"We are nervous but Element Magazine is not a gay rights magazine. It is a lifestyle magazine that takes care of Asian gay men,\" they say. \"What we want to do is for the magazine to be out there for the community, especially young gay men who may think that being gay is wrong because of what they read in mainstream media,\" says Hiro. \"We also try to balance entertainment and education in Element Magazine, so instead of just fashion and grooming, we cover issues like HIV or how to come out.\" But not only is sex between men illegal, there are also censorship guidelines in Singapore which ban media outlets from promoting homosexual acts. \"Exactly what is prohibited is grey but the familiar line is that you are not supposed to portray homosexuality in a positive or normal way,\" says Ms Chua from the National University of Singapore. \"So is an interview of a celebrity who is in a same-sex relationship considered the promotion of homosexuality? Apparently yes, because the broadcaster has been fined before.\" Hiro and Noel consulted lawyers and were told that the rule only applies to broadcast and print media, not online. So Element Magazine is published in digital form. But for Hiro, who holds a Chinese passport with permanent residency in Japan, and Noel, who is not gay himself, why choose Singapore to launch the magazine? \"It is more for human rights and we are doing it for the freedom to love,\" Noel explains. Drag queen Kumar, who has been pushing boundaries for more than 20 years, said things were very hard when he started performing in 1992. \"I had to go on stage and be heckled and be called names, but I wanted to show that there are drag queens who wanted to be respected.\" Today, he is enormously popular and his audience are truly from across the board. Even the law against homosexuality, he says, gives him an extra kick. \"I like this undercurrent lifestyle. We secretly go out for a gay night at a bar and we have a sign saying 'private function',\" he laughs. \"Our government never said we cannot be gay. They are just worried about conservatives.\" Senior pastor Lawrence Khong of the Faith Community Baptist Church is one vocal advocate against any change in the law. In his statement when former prime minister Goh Chok Tong was at his church in January, he said that \"the repeal of similar laws have led to negative social changes, especially the breakdown of the family as a basic building block and foundation of the society\". \"It takes away the rights of parents over what their children are taught in schools, especially sex education. \"It attacks religious freedom and eventually denies free speech to those who, because of their moral convictions, uphold a different view from that championed by increasingly aggressive homosexual activists,\" he added.

Some of them offer glimpses in to the home lifestyle of the Beckham clan - like this one of his sister Harper drawing. Others are taken from his own travels around the world. This one of a set designer was taken during the shooting of Guy Ritchie's movie King Arthur - which his father David appeared in. But while his photographs have helped him build up more than 10 million Instagram followers - not everybody has been positive. One picture of an elephant received particular ire on social media. Brooklyn had added to his dimly-lit shot with a caption explaining elephants were \"so hard to photograph\". Some Twitter users who did a quick search on Google Images disagreed with that. One critic - the arts editor of the i paper, Alice Jones - also poked fun at a couple of the photos and their somewhat minimalistic captions, in a comment which received more than 11,000 retweets. But writing in GQ, Eleanor Davies said many critics were just \"being snide\". \"At just 18 Brooklyn Beckham is very young for a published photographer and he should be proud of this book,\" she wrote. \"Critics should give Brooklyn Beckham a break and encourage this budding photographer. After all, David Bailey didn't even get his first photography job as an assistant until he was 21.\" Elle's Katie O'Malley described him as a \"star on the rise\", while Heat World's Aimee Jakes said the book as \"bloody brilliant\", adding: \"It's definitely something you'll want on your coffee table bbz.\" Writing in Dazed, Charlie Brinkhurst-Cuff said some of the images were \"poorly planned\" but added: \"Not all of the pictures in the book are arguably as worthy of criticism.\" In an open letter, the BBC's arts editor Will Gompertz told Brooklyn: \"The snide remarks being made about your work are cheap and self-serving. Ignore them.\" Writing in The Guardian, Marina Hyde took a more analytical approach, debating the pros and cons of celebrity children being given more opportunities than other people their own age. \"Fittingly, the fuss over Brooklyn Beckham's debut book of photography is a little out of focus,\" she wrote.

{"article": "Initially the only proof was the occasional funeral for a Hezbollah fighter killed in Syria and it was impossible to ascertain how many Shia fighters from Lebanon were in Syria or exactly what their role was. Now for the first time, the BBC has seen direct evidence of Hezbollah's role in some of the key battles as the Assad regime claims to be regaining the upper hand. And the clearest indication of Hezbollah's involvement has come from the group itself. In a relatively rare televised speech on Tuesday, the group's head, Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, declared: \"Syria has real friends who will not let it fall to the US, Israel or Islamic radicals\". Saying that the armed opposition groups were too weak to bring down President Assad's regime, Sheikh Nasrallah mused that when rebels were threatening to capture villages under (Syrian) government control, it was \"normal to offer every possible and necessary aid to help the Syrian army\". Hezbollah has long provided medical, logistical and practical help for Syrian refugees fleeing the fighting. But in the last week we saw first-hand how, in some areas, Hezbollah fighters were openly and freely crossing the border between Lebanon and Syria - giving training and military support to their allies in Syria. Here, in the northern Bekaa Valley, the official \"border\" between Lebanon and Syria means very little to many villages and communities. Locals have traded, inter-married and moved freely across the valleys and mountains for much longer than the infamous Anglo-French (Sykes-Picot) agreement which, less than 100 years ago, carved up the Middle East along lines that barely recognised realities and relationships on the ground. It is just across the border, in the pivotal Syrian town of Quseir, that some of the heaviest fighting is taking place. Not far from Homs, images and testimony from Quseir suggest that Hezbollah fighters are increasingly involved in the fighting itself and in directing inexperienced, irregular pro-government troops. The Syrian army, large and as well-equipped as it is, is undoubtedly overstretched - trying to contain a two-year-old rebellion across such a large country. So whatever Hezbollah is able to do in Quseir, Homs and the suburbs of Damascus is an increasingly vital part of the regime's military strategy. Things on the ground are visibly changing. Here, in some parts of Lebanon's north-eastern corner, both sides of the border are now, in effect, controlled by Hezbollah and its Syrian allies. They claim to be gaining advantage. Under the watchful eye of the \"popular local committees\" we were able to get right up to and across the Syrian border. On their side of the small stream that officially divides the two countries, Syrian conscripts looked on as we jumped across the gap to meet a contact on the other side. Abu Mohammed, a fighter with a pro-government Syrian militia unit, would only speak to us on the condition that we were inside Syria. It was a nervy, brief encounter. The frontline of Quseir is only a few kilometres to the east and the sound of heavy shelling punctuated our interview. In the cover of a small orchard, and surrounded by uniformed men armed with AK-47 rifles, it was apparent that in this area at least, Hezbollah, the Syrian army and pro-government militias are operating as one. Despite evidence to the contrary, Abu Mohammed insisted that Hezbollah was not directly involved in the fighting. \"They give us logistical and medical help and they're helping us regain territory but they're not fighting,\" said the militia leader, his face almost completely covered by a green and white scarf or keffiyeh. \"We're defending our land from the rebels who bomb our villages. But we'll stand up to them and they'll get what's coming to them,\" he replied when I asked him about fears that the involvement of Lebanese groups like Hezbollah in the fighting would destabilise relations in the fractious border area. I crossed a small wooden bridge back across the stream into Lebanon as, 170ft (50m) along the road, a small unit of regular Syrian soldiers kept watch at a junction in the road. In this area at least, the Assad regime is holding ground, even pushing back against previous rebel advances. But the real fear is that the involvement of Hezbollah, and other Lebanese factions, means the fighting will spill over into Lebanon itself. It is already happening. Well inside Lebanon, the Shia town of Hermel has been repeatedly and deliberately targeted by anti-regime rebels in Syria because it supports the Assad regime and is accused of sending fighters across the border. Locals took me up to the roof of a three-storey house through which a considerably large rocket had crashed just days before. Luckily no-one was hurt on that occasion but there have been civilian casualties on this side of the border, in addition to the estimated 70,000 killed by the civil war inside Syria itself. Not everyone here is supportive of Hezbollah's visibly active role inside Syria. Abu Alawa is a village elder who talks fondly about the cross-border, inter-communal relationships before the fighting began. \"There are more moderate voices within the Shia community who should play a role in resolving the conflict,\" Abu Alawa says. But his is almost a lone voice in an increasingly sectarian and tense region. Not only in Syria itself, but in neighbouring Lebanon, the longer the fighting continues then fault lines between Sunni and Shia Muslims are being dangerously exposed. At Sunni mosques in Lebanon, young men are being radicalised. Particularly in cities like Tripoli, where the sectarian divisions in Syria are mirrored in the city's own tense communities and districts, clerics fire up their followers with calls for Jihad, or holy war. In recent weeks, several imams have publicly called on young men to sign up and head east to fight. Critics mock the gesture as a publicity stunt but when I travelled to Tripoli to meet Sheikh Salem Rafii, he said it was a necessary response to Hezbollah's role in the fighting. \"This is a legitimate fatwa - a ruling from God, from the Koran,\" said the sheikh as we sat in his garden within sight of the mountain range that divided this part of Lebanon from Syria. \"There are oppressed people there [in Syria]. Women and children are being raped, killed and expelled. So any just Lebanese person should go and help them - and will be rewarded by God,\" he said. Lebanon's own future is threatened by the turmoil in Syria. The longer it continues, the more nervous the army and the interested parties on the Lebanese side of the border will get. Geographically surrounded and historically dominated by its larger neighbour, it was perhaps too much to expect that Lebanon and its own sectarian divided factions, could ever realistically remain immune to events next door.", "question": "The militant Lebanese Shia @placeholder , Hezbollah , has long been suspected of sending fighters across the border to help the Syrian regime of Bashar al - Assad .", "option_0": "harmony", "option_1": "organisation", "option_2": "community", "option_3": "winds", "option_4": "phenomenon", "label": 1}

{"article": "She is a Harvard educated doctor who, unlike in the film portrayal of Facebook's beginnings, has been by Mark's side for much of the last nine years. Now, Mark Zuckerberg and Dr Priscilla Chan are Silicon Valley's most influential power couple. And that's because, over the past year, Mark Zuckerberg has grown up. He's no longer the nerdy, dorky techie in a hoodie who cut a nervous, awkward figure when speaking in public. He's now a man that wears - gasp - a suit when welcoming, and being welcomed in by, heads of state. He's a man who learned Mandarin in what seemed like just a few months, using his new language to impress a room full of Chinese students - oh, and Xi Jinping, the Chinese president. And he's Dad to a baby girl now too, let's not forget. Max was born during Thanksgiving week, the couple announced on Tuesday. Zuckerberg to take two months' paternity leave Facebook hits one billion users in a day Facebook paid Â£4,327 UK corporation tax in 2014 Meanwhile, his site's valuation continues to soar. In business matters, he's made several shrewd acquisitions. Instagram, WhatsApp, and virtual reality firm Oculus Rift - all purchases that cemented Facebook's longevity, even if the site itself isn't cool with the kids anymore. All this while embodying something quite rare in Silicon Valley - a healthy work-life balance. Following Mark Zuckerberg on Facebook is like watching a friend on a gap year. Barely a day passes without Zuckerberg reflecting on the meaning of life while taking pictures of the Taj Mahal. And with the birth of his daughter, Max, Zuckerberg will be taking the unusual step (in the US at least) of taking two months paternity leave. He joins a recent trend of US tech companies taking the family needs of staff seriously. It might just kick-start a change in mood across the entire country - paid paternity and maternity leave is a given in much of the development world, but not in the USA. Yet the big announcement today - for the rest of us, at least - is about the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. Following in the footsteps of Bill and Melinda Gates, whose foundation has backed various charitable efforts for more than 15 years, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative says it seeks to back programs that promote \"equality, education and advancing human capability\". It will be funded by Zuckerberg's shares. He says he plans to give away 99% of his stock over the course of his lifetime, at a rate of around $1bn-worth each year. What will it do? That's to be seen, although in making the announcement Facebook was keen to point out that Zuckerberg's previous charitable endeavours included multi-million dollar donations to schools and hospitals, and money towards preventing the spread of Ebola. But it's not a flawless record, by any means. Many will question Zuckerberg's sincerity when, while donating to schools on one hand, his company is paying miniscule taxes in some of its biggest markets. Take the UK, for example, where in its last financial year the company paid just Â£4,327 ($6,643) in corporation tax. And then there's the political influence. In the information pack about the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, it notes that the money will be used for \"funding non-profit organizations, making private investments and participating in policy debates, in each case with the goal of generating positive impact in areas of great need\". Silicon Valley's definition of \"great need\" may differ greatly to what the rest of the world thinks needs to be done, while \"participating in policy debates\" is another way of saying \"lobbying\", of course. And we may never be told what those \"private investments\" are. Mark Zuckerberg's internet.org project, which is about bringing internet connectivity to the next billion people, has been caught up in controversy. Small businesses in the developing world say internet.org is little more than a thinly-veiled way for Facebook to rapidly grow their user base. Still, Mark Zuckerberg is 31. Priscilla Chan is 30. Max is merely days old. The Chan Zuckerberg story still has decades in which to shape itself. Some will take a dim view of a data collection company expanding its influence into new, highly-political territories. Others will applaud a very rich, young couple for taking some of technology's billions out from the Valley and into needy causes.

{"article": "Each year, 1,691 children in the UK are diagnosed with cancer. In England and Wales, 82% of those diagnosed survive for five years or more. If you Google \"How do I tell my child they have cancer\" you get 201 million results - a whole host of organisations, charities and people wanting to help. But experts say it's important to keep things simple. On those sites, you will discover the many different terms used to describe cancer ranging from \"tumour\" to \"poorly blood\". But these different terms can confuse children, according to Helen Lythgoe, a children's lead Macmillan nurse, and she advises that it is better to stick with one term you feel comfortable with. It is often better to use the word cancer and be clear about what it means, as children may hear the word used in a different context and worry about it. Michael Buble \"devastated\" by son's diagnosis Ms Lythgoe warns parents not to be scared to talk to their child about what is happening and, because of the emotions surrounding the diagnosis, to plan what you're going to say. She says: \"Children are very matter-of-fact about things. Once they know what is going on they will generally carry on as normal. \"It is often better to explain what's happening bit by bit, or when there is a change, this helps to build up their understanding so is not overwhelming.\" Talking about cancer and the diagnosis can be reassuring, according to the NHS Live Well website, but the approach of parents may differ depending on the age of their child and what they may understand. For example, Cancer.net says that very young children will not understand much about cancer; their primary fear is that they will be taken away from their parents and this is what they need reassurance about. As children get older they are less likely to think their condition was caused by something they did or thought, says cancer.net. They start understanding more that they will need to undergo other treatment. All children need reassurance that: Older children may hear about cancer from other sources including the TV, and the internet, so parents should encourage them to share what they have learned. Teenagers may have lots of questions and be interested in learning more about their diagnosis, often thinking about the disease in terms of the effect on daily life, such as school, sports, and friends. Side effects relating to their physical appearance can be a priority for them and some may want to play a role in making decisions about their treatment. Whatever the age of the child, the most important way any parent can help is simply to talk.", "question": "Singer Michael Buble and his actress wife Luisana Lopilato have revealed their three - year - old son has cancer .

{"article": "\"I'm going to spend it on Oliver,\" she says. Chloe is a single parent who is juggling work as a carer at a nursing home in Sheffield and looking after Oliver, aged three. She currently earns £6.81 an hour and works eighteen hours a week. \"It's tough having childcare and bills to pay for and making sure that he's fed and warm. Every penny is accounted for.\" She reckons she'll earn an extra £30 a month when her pay rises to £7.20 an hour on 1 April. \"It'll make a big difference to me and to Oliver, It can't come soon enough\", she tells me. Chloe says she couldn't work without her local nursery. She's able to drop Oliver off at 7:30am, enabling her to get to work on time. The Firth Park Little Treasures Nursery is a small but busy facility, tucked away on the site of a local church. When we visit, Oliver runs off to give his care worker, Carly Fox, a cuddle. She too is about to get a pay rise. Aged 31, Carly works full time on £6.70 an hour, the current national minimum wage. She could be £900 better off over the next year. \"It will make quite a big difference. I'm still going to struggle but it will be a lot better than what it is,\" she says. \"Financially it means I'll be able to sort myself out with my debts and hopefully be able to start treating myself to a few things extra\" Chloe and Carly are just two of the estimated 1.3 million workers over 25 who will directly benefit from the new legal wage floor, dubbed the national living wage (NLW) when Chancellor George Osborne made his surprise announcement last summer. It's the biggest shift to the legal minimum wage in years. The NLW will rise, year-on-year until 2020 when it is projected to be more than £9 an hour. By then, some six million employees are likely to have received some increase in their pay as a result. But nursery owner, Anita Bingham, is worrying how to pay for it. Five of her staff, including Carly, will qualify for the new rate. \"It's a lot of money to a small business like mine that's just set up. I am going to struggle,\" she says. Anita says she can't put up fees because most of her parents are entitled to 15 hours of free childcare which is paid by the government. \"I can't get rid of staff either because I need the ratios for the amount of children that we've got - so it's go to the toys and all the equipment we use.\" These will have to be cut back on. I ask her about the prospect of paying out more than £9 an hour by 2020. \"I'm dreading that, it's going to be a big stretch. I will close, it's as simple as that unless the government decides to put up the fees and I can rethink it,\" she says. She wants to pay her staff more, but how to make the sums add up? That's the dilemma facing thousands of other businesses, especially small ones. Anita only earns the minimum wage herself. No one can say for sure how this big policy change will play out. The Resolution Foundation reckons almost a third of Sheffield's workers will benefit from the new living wage over the next four years, a higher proportion of employees than any other major UK city. But Sheffield wants to go even further. Its council is already paying workers £8.25 an hour, the level set by the Living Wage Foundation. In an eye catching move, it recently announced business rate relief for other employers who do the same. Professor of regional studies at Sheffield University, Gordon Dabinett, says £7.20 an hour is too low to survive. \"Our studies have shown that it's not enough to live on. And therefore if they're not earning enough money, that leads to crisis in the household in a family and that leads to further problems such as debt and other associated problems,\" he says. \"There are always unintended consequences. If jobs are lost immediately in some sectors or in some companies then I'm quite confident they'll be regained later. \"Obviously it doesn't help individuals faced with those hard decisions and businesses faced with those particular circumstances but all the evidence from studies in America at the moment show that the introduction of a living wage has long term economic benefits,\" says Prof Dabinett. \"We think for a fair city, people should be given a fair wage.\" Few would disagree with that but its clear there is no easy route to lifting millions of workers out of low pay.", "question": "Chloe Brown does n't have to think when asked what she will do when she gets her pay rise to @placeholder the new so - called living wage .", "option_0": "attend", "option_1": "treat", "option_2": "control", "option_3": "reflect", "option_4": "make", "label": 3}

On Hamilton, a Mercedes spokesman said he had a \"high fever\" in the morning and \"didn't feel comfortable.\" The 30-year-old world champion stopped after completing just 11 laps. Mercedes reserve driver Pascal Wehrlein replaced Hamilton as the Briton's team-mate Nico Rosberg is nursing a sore nerve in his neck, which doctors have told him to rest. Rosberg is scheduled to drive the car on Friday, but his participation is in doubt because of his condition. Mercedes initially said they chose Wehrlein rather than Hamilton's team-mate Nico Rosberg because they had a heavy programme and that if Hamilton did not recover it would be unrealistic to expect one driver to do all four days of the test. However, the team has now confirmed that Rosberg has inflamed a nerve in his neck which needs resting and his own participation on Friday is also in doubt. Hamilton had been fifth fastest up to that point as the teams continue their preparations for the start of the season in Melbourne, Australia, next month. Sauber's Brazilian rookie Nasr set the pace during the morning, with a lap of one minute 27.307, 0.056 seconds quicker than Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo. McLaren-Honda, who had a troubled first test in Jerez, again hit problems, despite a promising start. Jenson Button completed 21 laps - nearly a third of the entire running the team managed at the first pre-season test earlier this month - and ended the morning sixth fastest, just 0.875 secs off the pace. Button had been second fastest to Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen after two and a half hours. However, his running was then brought to an end after Honda discovered a faulty seal on the motor-generator unit recovering energy from the rear axle. Honda said it would need to redesign the component to prevent the problem recurring and that the new part would not be ready until Saturday. So although Fernando Alonso will have an engine for Friday, the same problem as affected Button may well recur then. All the teams confirmed for entry in this year's championship are in Barcelona. Force India - for whom Mercedes' Wehrlein had been invited to drive for the two days of testing - are running a 2014 car. Force India race driver Sergio Perez will take over the car for the afternoon, although they were awaiting final confirmation.

{"article": "To get to Utoeya, we board the MS Thorbjorn - the same passenger ferry that took Anders Breivik to the island on 22 July. Dressed as a policeman, and heavily armed, he'd set off with one aim: to commit mass murder. As the MS Thorbjorn nears Utoeya, I find it hard to imagine the horrors which unfolded there. Even under the cover of  thick cloud, this tiny island looks so beautiful. It's like a jewel in the middle of Lake Tyrifjorden. Its forests of pine and silver birch are an explosion of autumn colour. Within minutes, we reach the island. I leave the ferry and pass the white administration building. It is here that Breivik shot his first victims. The island looks strangely normal. It's almost as if the Young Labour summer camp has been frozen in time. At the storehouse, the entertainment schedule for the day of the attack is still pinned to the wall. It lists what the campers should have been doing that evening: football at 18:00, then a disco at 22:30. The summer camp refreshment tent 'Utoeya Waffles' is still standing. There are neat rows of picnic tables. The island kiosk still has supplies in the shop window: toothpaste, shampoo and hot chocolate. The poster behind the glass declares: 'Utoeya: Welcome to the island. The Nordic Paradise.' Anders Breivik's shooting spree on Utoeya had lasted more than seventy minutes. He killed 69 people. As I walk around the island I see hints of the carnage: boarded-up windows and some bullet holes. I find a nature trail known as the 'Love Path'. It leads through the forest to cliffs. During the attack, some of the campers had climbed down here and taken cover in the rocks. Breivik had shot at them from the fence above. Others tried to swim to safety through the icy waters of the lake. The gunman targeted them, too. I move on to the 'School Hut'. During the shooting, 47 people had barricaded themselves in here. Among them was Jorid Nordmelan. I met Jorid in Oslo before my trip to Utoeya. She told me her dramatic story. \"I picked up my mattress and put it in front of the window,\" Jorid recalls. \"Then I crawled under the bed. Right at that moment someone was shooting at the door in the living room.\" \"We were so scared because we knew we had lost control of our lives. We couldn't run anywhere. \"I actually thought through my own funeral. I planned what kind of tunes to be played and which priest I wanted. I was certain this was my final hour,\" she said. \"Then we got our mobile phones working and started checking the news. I saw that the BBC was covering the story. I thought, 'What? The BBC covering Norway? Something enormous must be happening'.\" Even after Anders Breivik was arrested, Jorid's ordeal was not over. \"Then I saw him. The person who did this. He was standing there with handcuffs on in front of the main house. \"He looked kind of evil. But he was laughing. So I thought this couldn't be him. \"It had to be some mistake. Because I didn't think that anyone who shot so many people could be laughing afterwards\". Jorid was among the last group of survivors to leave Utoeya. Only on reaching the mainland did she realise the scale of the tragedy. \"There were body bags lying everywhere. We could see feet sticking out and white plastic covering heads. \"I couldn't believe it. I cracked and fell down. I couldn't stand on my feet any more,\" she said. \"I think about what happened every day. I hope I will think about this every single day for the rest of my life. \"I hope it will fill me up in a good way, so that I have perspective.

{"article": "By December 1961, a small team of Cambridge graduates, squashed into a Series 2 model, had travelled for 15 months along the Pan-American Highway. Starting at the southern tip of Argentina, the group travelled through 17 different countries until they finally reached the most northerly US state. But just 500 miles short of the Arctic Circle, the road came to an end at Fairbanks, Alaska, and they were beaten back by the harsh winter. Mike Andrews, Ben Mackworth-Praed and Martin Hugh-Jones had to admit defeat and sold their Land Rover to a car dealer in Anchorage to cover their fares home. Mr Mackworth-Praed chronicled the moment in his book, Year with Three Summers: \"Even for $1,850, we were sorry to part with it; we knew every bolt in the frame, every rattle, and could interpret its noises like an oracle. But we had to get home, and there was a heavy bill coming for air tickets.\" The vehicle had certainly been put through its paces on the route, which would have been largely off-road at the time. The \"Cambridge TransAmerican Expedition\" set out from Buenos Aires in September 1960, travelled throughout Argentina down to Tierra Del Fuego, then up through South America, the US and Canada up to Alaska. Mr Andrews and Mr Mackworth-Praed were engineering graduates, invited to help with car maintenance, while vets Andy Bacon and Martin Hugh-Jones carried out epidemiological studies of cattle and sheep throughout Latin America. Their adventures included crossing the Andes 15 times, searching out new animal populations and archaeological sites, a week with the Welsh colony in Patagonia and negotiating treacherous conditions during an Alaskan ice storm. The Land Rover was pulled by oxen through a river in Costa Rica, driven along railway tracks to stop it sinking on salt flats between Chile and Bolivia and had the paint sand-blasted off it by strong winds as they drove into Patagonia. It had carried them across mountains, deserts, forests, rivers and salt flats, \"The sheer difficulty of travel was considerable. The Land Rover basically disintegrated en route - we broke practically every part of it. We got to Alaska and it had to have major rebuilds because the roads were appalling,\" Mr Andrews said. \"The roads were so bad that our heads were constantly banging on the roof.\" While the vehicle had been put through its paces - springs, shock absorbers and other parts were constantly replaced on the trip - its aluminium bodywork did not rust. On the 50th anniversary of the trip, Mr Andrews wrote a piece for Land Rover Owner International magazine. To his astonishment, the vehicle's current owner, based in Anchorage, Alaska, recognised the expedition's logo, which had survived on its side since. \"It was pretty derelict at the time,\" Mr Andrews said, \"but in the five years since the vehicle has been renovated by [Land Rover enthusiast] Eddie Angel and, amazingly, all three of us who drove it to Alaska in 1961 are all going out there again.\" Mr Andrews, 76, from Bristol, a retired executive producer with the BBC's Natural History Unit, and his fellow adventurers Mr Mackworth-Praed, 79, and Prof Martin Hugh-Jones, 79, will join a small convoy of vintage Land Rovers for the journey from Fairbanks, Alaska, to Prudhoe Bay, on the Arctic Coast in August. Sadly, their teammate Mr Bacon has since died. The trip has been organised by Mr Angel and photo-journalist Michael Rudd, who will be documenting the journey. They have been documenting the Land Rover's repair  on Facebook and say it will \"retain all its battle scars and bruises\". They say the vehicle, despite its vast mileage, is \"very solid and will need just basic maintenance to drive the rest of the voyage\". While road conditions have generally improved, Mr Andrews is not expecting a smooth ride. The Dalton Highway is essentially a huge dirt track, which featured in the first episode of the BBC series \"World's Most Dangerous Roads\". They will have to dodge oil tankers and mosquitoes, and avoid skidding on the gravel road in a 55-year-old Land Rover that has not had an easy life. Mr Andrews said he was a bit anxious he might get to Alaska and find the 4x4 \"won't move.\" But he said its owner, Mr Angel, is a Land Rover enthusiast, so they are in \"good hands\". \"I think it will be brilliant,\" he said. \"You could call it the trip of a lifetime. \"I was the baby of the team - I'm 76 now, the other two are 79 - the challenge I think will be to stay awake on those endless gravel roads,\" he said.", "question": "More than 50 years after they came agonisingly close to completing \" the ultimate road trip \" , three adventurers are set to return to Alaska in a bid to finish the last leg of the 40,000 - mile journey in the same @placeholder Land Rover which almost took them across the Americas .", "option_0": "group", "option_1": "zone", "option_2": "state", "option_3": "space", "option_4": "battered", "label": 4}

{"article": "Mourinho is expected to replace sacked Louis van Gaal, with talks ongoing between his agent Jorge Mendes and United officials. But it has emerged that Chelsea still own the 'Jose Mourinho' name as a trademark - meaning United may need to pay a six-figure sum for the rights. However, the issue will not scupper any deal, which is expected this week. Discussions will now enter a third day, despite the deal to bring the 53-year-old former Chelsea boss to Old Trafford being largely complete. On Wednesday, Mourinho told waiting reporters at his home in London that he was going to Portugal. Chelsea registered both the name Jose Mourinho and his signature as a European trademark in 2005, meaning they can use it to sell merchandise such as toiletries, technology, clothing and jewellery. Sports lawyer Carol Couse told BBC Sport it was \"really unusual\" for an individual not to own the trademark to their own name. \"Chelsea could be earning revenue every time someone uses Mourinho's name. It could prevent United from exploiting his signature,\" said Couse, of law firm Mills & Reeve. \"One of the things United will be looking to acquire is not only Mourinho's image but also his name. \"If United had a brand of Mourinho clothing it would be in breach of the trademark Chelsea currently own.\" What are the possible solutions? Mourinho cannot override the trademark, so the options are: \"That would be pretty costly,\" said Couse, who estimated the fee for a licence as \"hundreds of thousands of pounds\". \"Look at the value of the deals that have been done for Mourinho to date. What would be the value of a Jose Mourinho watch? \"He has managed Inter and Real since then. They have either acquired the rights from Chelsea or managed the use of his name. \"If Chelsea didn't grant a licence, every time United used Jose Mourinho's name in a commercial capacity against those products, Chelsea could sue Manchester United. I would suspect United would rather just pay a licence fee.\" There is also potential conflict between Mourinho's personal deals - such as his one with car manufacturer Jaguar - and United's shirt sponsor agreement with Chevrolet. \"I don't think that in itself would hold up any negotiation,\" Couse explained. \"A lot of world-class players go to Manchester United with their own personal deals. Mourinho's deals will be in a personal capacity.\" Couse said United cannot force Mourinho to drive a Chevrolet car, for example, or wear Chevrolet clothes outside of club capacity, but they could pay him an incentive to buy out the Jaguar deal early.

{"article": "Mr Letwin was putting in an appearance before the Commons public administration committee which left MPs a little baffled. He said he believed that the charity was \"grossly\" mismanaged, misstated its statistics and needed a leadership clearout. Yet he did not think he made any errors in disbursing £7.3m of public funds to Kids Company since April. This led him into rather odd territory. For example, Bernard Jenkin, the chair, was incredulous when Mr Letwin said that he always believed \"a distinct gap between the claims for the numbers going on in public and what was really happening\". He thought that the charity was not helping as many people it was claiming. But, Mr Letwin explained, those published figures were not the basis on which the charity was supported by the government. His argument was, at times, also rather peculiar. For example, Mr Letwin attempted to knock back the idea that he was in thrall to Camila Batmanghelidjh, its chief executive. He revealed the details of how he handled what would prove to be Kids Company's last request for more money from the government - a request that came in mid-May from Alan Yentob, its chair of trustees and the BBC's creative director. The request came just six weeks after receiving what was supposed to be a final grant of £4.265m. He told MPs: \"I was sitting in a car in my constituency on the carphone. I took the call from Alan [Yentob] which my office had arranged... He said: 'If you don't give us some extra money now, we will go bust almost immediately.' I said, as I say, 'So be it'. I had made it clear that the £4.265m was the last such grant and I didn't find it hard to make that objective assessment.\" But it was not \"So be it\" to the closure. A few weeks later, Mr Letwin overruled officials to order a further payment of £3m to the charity. When pressed on this point, Mr Letwin said that he only did this on the condition that the charity changed its management and closed some of its services, so he was being tough. Not so. Other charities do not get impromptu £3m bailouts. Mr Letwin was also pressed on the question of why the charity was given the money when the Cabinet Office was in possession of what someone in the department called a \"gobsmacking\" interim report, written by PWC. This contained details of bizarre spending - it showed one client was being paid almost £1,000 a week. The minister knew the charity spent more than £50,000 funding someone described as the child of an Iranian diplomat, including their PhD study. He knew that two young people who have a relative working for a charity received support worth more than £130,000. His answer was that he could only cut off Kids Company if a Charity Commission statutory inquiry were launched. It is not clear why. Mr Letwin's argument was, at root, that he thought Kids Company did excellent work despite shambolic management. So, he argued, the core of what it did needed to preserved, even if the management did not. But he did not give a good explanation of why he thought it was so valuable. For example, when pressed on why he was convinced Kids Company deserved such generosity, Mr Letwin said he had visited it in 2001 to 2003 - more than a decade ago. He also brought up work by Methods Consulting, research which had been conducted at the behest of the Department for Education to assess the charity. But Methods' work seems to have been weak. As the NAO wrote, the \"scope of its work did not include looking at the quality of the charity's services\".  Methods only measured the volume of work - and it got whacky results. For example, the charity was set a target of 1,347 \"interventions\" in 2013 to 14. According to the NAO, they delivered 30,217. This does not suggest a well-calibrated measure. Mr Letwin's view about its safeguarding practice was also debatable. He was wrong to claim Kids Company was not unusual, for a charity of its size, in not being inspected, regulated or overseen by either Ofsted or a local authority. And Mr Letwin's retort that the staff had been vetted for prior criminal convictions is to miss the point. As Newsnight and BuzzFeed News reported, there are serious questions about whether it was effective at keeping young people safe. So how to judge Mr Letwin's performance? The select committee will report in the New Year. The minister did not win them over. He rather confirmed the sense that Kids Company was a well connected charity which threatened ministers with the consequences of its own closure - and Mr Letwin could not make a convincing, positive case for the funding he gave it. Still, he did manage one thing. The hearing was about him, not his boss, the Prime Minister. Tim Loughton, a former children's minister, told the committee earlier that David Cameron was \"mesmerised\" by Ms Batmanghelidjh. If that was - as expected - the end of the public administration committee's process, the Prime Minister may have got away with not being dragged into this row.", "question": "The minister who overruled civil service objections to pay a £ 3 m grant to the now - @placeholder charity Kids Company just days before it collapsed has said that he does not regret his decision .

{"article": "George King's try was awarded by the video referee with three minutes to go, before Chris Sandow completed the win with his late effort. Rhys Evans' double and Ben Currie's effort added to the Wolves' total. Catalans, already beaten by Hull on home soil, scored through Todd Carney, Pat Richards and Vincent Duport. The victory was Warrington's fifth in succession, with themselves and Wigan the only two sides to retain 100% records so far this season. It was a disappointing reunion with his former club for Catalans half-back Richie Myler, who saw his new side beaten and was involved in a heavy tackle by Chris Hill that saw the Wolves skipper placed on report. Dragons head coach Laurent Frayssinous was visibly frustrated by the late video referee call for King's try. However, there was little debate about Sandow's try that finished the game, which made it three defeats for the hosts in the opening five fixtures. Catalans Dragons head coach Laurent Frayssinous: \"I think that there are rules in rugby league, you cannot move forward until the foot touches the ball at the play the ball.

We're probably not oozing with execution or smarts (smart play) at times, and we're coming up with a few too many errors. \"But we were pretty confident that we could get ahead in the game, but we needed to control the ball and use the wind in the second half and we didn't do that in the early stages of the second half. \"But about 20 minutes into the second half we felt like we were going to come home even stronger. \"Some of that was down to good defence, some good fitness and good execution.

{"article": "Nick D'Aloisio told the BBC he was currently deciding between working full-time for the California-based company or going to university. The 18-year-old has just released an iPad edition of Yahoo's News Digest, for which he acts as project manager. He is also developing an Apple Watch version, among other projects. \"For the lightweight news consumption that we have, [News] Digest is absolutely suited for this device,\" he said. \"Because of the summarisation element to this app, it just inherently makes sense when you have a constrained screen. \"We've been thinking about designing the concept of taking Digest to wearables for a while now, and we're going to jump at the opportunity.\" The app's icon briefly features during the Watch promotional video on Apple's site. Mr D'Aloisio said his team had already begun work on the software before the launch event, but had been kept \"in the dark\" about how the device functioned. He added that he also intended to bring the app to Android Wear smartwatches. News Digest has already been downloaded to about 1.3 million iPhones and 623,000 Android handsets, according to analytics provider Xyo. Yahoo would not confirm those numbers, but said that it believed: Mr D'Aloisio was only 16 years old when he secured a $250,000 (Â£154,000) investment in his software from Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-Shing. He subsequently launched the app Summly as a standalone news-summarisation product, but it was only a few months before Yahoo acquired the technology and his services, in a deal reported to be worth Â£20m. Since then he has headed up a team of about a dozen software engineers and designers to create and run News Digest, at the same time as sitting his A-level exams. Yahoo's app delivers two daily briefings of eight to nine stories, which are assembled by algorithms using text, images and videos sourced from online providers including: Once the user has clicked through all the material, a graphic tells them they are \"done\". \"It's been very intense because I'm accountable and in charge of this product,\" Mr D'Aloisio told the BBC. \"So, for the last year-and-a-half I've been flying back and forth between London and California.\" Having achieved high enough grades to qualify for his university offers, he now faces a choice as to whether to start a degree in October or not. \"I'm still undecided - I'm weighing up university and Yahoo,\" he explained. \"But I think there could be a nice middle ground here, where I think I could potentially... be doing some higher study as well as continuing on with Digest. \"I am still very passionate about continuing my education, that's precisely why I made sure I finished school with everyone else in my age group, But at the same time this is a great product and we're working on some really exciting things.\" For the moment, Mr D'Aloisio is promoting the iPad edition of Yahoo's app, which introduces new features. These include: The app can be downloaded globally and configured to run in a UK, US, Canadian or World edition. The software will compete against a growing number of other news briefing services including Flipboard, Circa and Feedly. Not everyone is enamoured with the idea of such services piggybacking the work of  journalists. \"The big question is, are these apps providing added value for readers and publishers, or are they just another parasitical kind of aggregator,\" asked Dominic Ponsford, editor of the Press Gazette site. \"There's so much aggregation going on online - just listing and lifting other people's stories and content isn't what you need.\" But Mr D'Aloisio defends News Digest's model, saying it acts as a \"trusted curator\", providing bite-sized chunks of news to busy readers, and offering links to the original sources for those with more time. Time is something he is now short of himself, and while he may be famous for being the \"teenage coder who made millions\", he acknowledges he does not do much programming himself anymore. \"I do dabble in the iPhone coding for the application, but by and large my role has moved from doing a lot of the coding to becoming more of a product manager - so, I'm in charge of the design, the branding, the strategy, the development of it,\" he said. \"That is by and large what I spend my time on. \"But I have also been helping out with a few other efforts that have yet to be announced.\"", "question": "The British teenager who @placeholder his news summary app to Yahoo for millions is facing a major life choice as he weighs education and business opportunities .", "option_0": "spent", "option_1": "launches", "option_2": "brings", "option_3": "sold", "option_4": "represents", "label": 3}

An idea to create a Subbuteo-type referee was scrapped before the public consultation stage last year.

It has been claimed the original rules of football were developed by students playing on Parker's Piece in 1848 and that the city centre green is the birthplace of football. A plaque at the city centre park already celebrates how the \"Cambridge Rules\" became the \"defining influence on the 1863 Football Association rules\". The Football Association, however, said although \"elements\" of the Cambridge Rules were in its own version, there were \"a number of differences\". Artists Neville Gabie together with Alan Ward, Kenny Hunter, Nayan Kulkarni and Mark Titchner have submitted proposals. They include a granite slab inscribed with the rules in different languages, a mirror-like design and bench, a life-size bronze of a female referee and a word sculpture. People are now being asked for their opinions on the designs until 5 December. One sculpture will be chosen by city councillors on 15 January.

{"article": "\"The war did not finish in 2008 - it continues every day, because the Russian occupiers are on our land,\" said protest organiser David Katsarava. Young and old held hands and stood in silence under the scorching sun. Many held Georgian flags and banners condemning Russia's occupation, which gave firepower to pro-Russian rebels. \"Our aim is to unite people and to give them the feeling that it's possible to change something in this war,\" says Mr Katsarava. In early August 2008, Georgia attempted to recapture breakaway South Ossetia, which had fought a separatist war with Georgia in the 1990s. The fighting in 2008 escalated after cross-border skirmishes. Russia responded with a massive invasion. It also seized control of Abkhazia, in support of separatists there. Both regions are internationally recognised as Georgian territory. The five-day war ended in humiliation for Georgia - several towns, a Black Sea port and military airfields were bombed by the Russian air force. Several hundred people were killed and thousands of ethnic Georgians displaced by the conflict. Georgian villages in South Ossetia were razed to the ground. The International Criminal Court (ICC) is conducting an investigation into alleged war crimes committed during the war. What is South Ossetia? Georgia timeline South Ossetia, officially part of Georgia, is separated from the North Ossetia region of Russia by an international border. It is inhabited mostly by Ossetians, who are ethnically and linguistically distinct from other peoples in the region. Most ethnic Georgians have been displaced from South Ossetia by conflict. Georgia, including South Ossetia, was part of the Russian empire in the 19th Century. After the 1917 communist revolution, Georgia became independent but it was declared part of the Soviet Union in 1921. After the 2008 war, Moscow recognised South Ossetia as an independent state and began a process of closer ties that Georgia views as effective annexation. South Ossetia and Abkhazia depend on Russia militarily and financially. Thousands of Russian troops are stationed in the two regions. Moscow has signed strategic agreements with both regions, bringing them firmly into its sphere of influence. While the Georgian protest was taking place Russian President Vladimir Putin was visiting Abkhazia. Just last week US Vice President Mike Pence visited Georgia.

{"article": "Back in the 1920s a handful of beer-makers shared a fear: what would happen if we lost our brewing yeast? They not only agreed such an occurrence would be very bad news, they also agreed on a solution - to deposit a sample of their all important yeast in a shared collection for safety. Today that collection - the National Collection of Yeast Cultures (NCYC) - is home to 4,000 different yeasts. They include all types of yeasts, including brewing, baking and industrial yeasts, from across the globe. Even yeasts found at the north and south poles have been collected and added to the collection. \"We are the Kew Gardens of the yeast world,\" says Dr Ian Roberts, curator at the NCYC. \"Yeasts are literally everywhere and are very important not just in brewing and baking but in areas like cancer research because yeasts are a model organism for research.\" Using different yeasts can change the taste of a beer dramatically, says Dr Roberts. \"Brewers tend to play it safe and they like to keep the yeasts they like to use,\" he says. But when a brewery's production yeast is destroyed - as happened in 2009 to a flooded brewery in the Lake District - the NCYC was able to get the operation \"back up and running\" with the very same yeast strain. Some brewers, however, are willing to take the plunge and explore the myriad taste-scape offered by yeast. One is micro-brewer Martin Warren, who owns the Poppyland Brewery in Cromer. \"I'm too small to compete head to head with the regional brewers and I don't brew beer that you would buy in pubs,\" says Mr Warren, a former museum curator. \"I am looking to have adventures with beer, I'm really just a grown-up home brewer who now has a full-scale brewery. \"It means that I can make the beers that other brewers dare not do, or cannot do.\" One of his latest beers is made using a yeast strain originally from Norwich unused since 1958. Presented with his yeast by the NCYC's Steve James, Mr Warren said: \"That must be the smell of beers from the 1950s. \"It is fruity, it is delicious. It is going to be great to brew with this. As my wife says if you put ingredients in, how can it go wrong?\" The end result is a beer called Hawkey Frolic, which was debuted - and feted as \"really lovely\" and \"really malty\" - at the Norwich Beer Festival. But where next for the nation's beer adventurers? Brewers, says Dr Roberts, are most likely to explore further into the past to the yeasts of the 1930s and 1920s. They might also soon have access to new yeasts created as a result of the NCYC's project to sequence the genomes of all of its strains. The idea, he says, was to find out the genetic basis for each yeast's special characteristics. This, in turn, could lead to new yeast strains with even better properties and flavours. And the chances of seeing a north or south pole beer any time soon? Very low sadly, says Dr Roberts, because these yeasts are not brewing yeasts.

{"article": "He is a director of football whose heart is still out on the pitch, and he casts his mind back almost three decades to the opportunity he was given when he first set foot in the club as a new boy plucked from non-league. He chuckles as he recalls telling the QPR manager in 1987, Jim Smith, that he couldn't join straight away as he had to work his month's notice as a van driver. \"I remember there were some guys who were just about to be released,\" Ferdinand, 48, recalls. \"They were saying, 'do you know, I might go and play non-league football. Two nights' work and still get paid £150 a week for playing'. \"I said: 'Are you guys mad? Are you seriously saying that? You have got to try your nuts off to stay in football! You don't believe what you have got'.\" The former England striker is a man with a stock of stories to tell about the precarious business of opportunities in the game: how they come about, how they can so easily slip through a player's fingers, how they can be nurtured - and seized. Reflecting on his own playing career and coaching experience, his is a voice worth listening to carefully at a time when Football Association chairman Greg Dyke is trumpeting ideas to find a host of English players like Harry Kane. Ah, Harry Kane. Having watched Kane and his Tottenham team-mates Ryan Mason and Andros Townsend celebrating together for England in Turin during the week, Ferdinand argues that the line between that happy picture and talent drifting unharnessed in the modern game could not be thinner. Kane, Mason and Townsend came through the development squad together at Spurs under the tutelage of Ferdinand, current QPR manager Chris Ramsey and Aston Villa boss Tim Sherwood. \"But I guarantee you now, had Tim, Chris and myself not taken over the first team, nobody would be talking about Kane, Mason and Townsend. Because we gave them the opportunity to play,\" stresses Ferdinand. \"They would not be playing at Tottenham otherwise. Andros went out on nine loans. Harry had four loans. Mason had five loans. They were no nearer the first team when they came back than when they went out on loan. It was only that we had been working with them and we knew we could put them in the first team and trust them. \"The average lifespan at any club for managers now is 11-12 months maximum. They haven't got time to think about player development.\" For all the talk of quotas to clear the pathway for youngsters, as far as Ferdinand is concerned there is a much more immediate problem for players getting stuck in the system. It's that critical age between 16 and 21 that Arsene Wenger pinpointed this week. \"That's the heart of the problem,\" said the Arsenal manager. \"Let's get better at that level, then if there is a problem integrating those players in the top teams, we have to do something about it. Today you have to be very brave to integrate the young players because the pressure is very high.\" That sentiment strikes a chord with Ferdinand. He understands why managers are loath to take a risk on a young player. But the system, he reckons, makes it extra difficult to take those risks. Why? Because youngsters at the top clubs are starved of competitive football at the highest level. The under-21 league, introduced by the Premier League as part of their Elite Player Performance Plan (EPPP) in place of old-style reserve-team football, is far too sterile for his liking. Ferdinand would scrap it in a heartbeat. \"It's not competitive enough,\" he says. \"Look at our squad. For the previous manager here [Harry Redknapp] if there was a problem in the first team he wasn't looking at the under 21s. He would rather go and take someone on loan who he knows has played competitive football against seasoned pros. \"That's what 99% of managers in the Premier League would do. They don't see the under-21 squad as being competitive enough, which is why these boys are not coming through.\" Ferdinand recalls his early days as a QPR player whisked out of non-league football. \"My first reserve game we had Clive Walker, Sammy Lee... all these experienced professional players. We played Southampton and they had Jimmy Case playing.\" His expression reveals that was an early lesson to the physical demands required. \"I am not going to get better experience than that. I am certainly not going to get it in the under-21s. \"These people helped you, they guided you through your football. In the under-21s if you have another kid telling you to push in here or there, they are not quite sure what they are doing. \"The other thing that happened is if you didn't play on Saturday you knew you were playing on Tuesday in the reserves, it didn't matter how big a player you were. And they didn't have the hump because it wasn't seen as a punishment. It was about keeping yourself fit to play football. \"Nowadays the senior players in the under-21 development games see it is a punishment. They don't want to play. So they end up not running around as they should do. \"Because I worked in under-21 football I understand that these players need to be given an opportunity. Otherwise you just have a creche. It is a bit messed up. They have to look at the whole picture.\" Given the complicated mix of stifled opportunity plus a generous salary - and all that at a sensitive age in between the teens and being a young adult - it doesn't seem to be the most productive environment. Intriguingly, when Ferdinand looks at his own chance as a young player, he admits he found it difficult to get his head around what was happening - and that was without agents in his ear and megabucks in his pocket. One day he was at Southall and Hayes, training twice a week after work and playing on the weekend. The next he was in the professional game. \"Instead of doing it for fun, suddenly it was my job. I struggled with that for a while,\" Ferdinand says. \"I needed to change my lifestyle and I didn't. I was a young kid from a council estate and was still running around with the guys I had been running around with before I joined QPR. It all happened very quickly. \"It took a while to adjust to the life of being a professional footballer. The truth is I probably didn't adjust to it until I went to Turkey, to Besiktas on loan in 1988. \"It was amazing not only as a football lesson but as a life lesson. I was on my own, the first British player to go to Turkey, in this environment I totally didn't know about. But I needed to do it. \"I realised I did want to be a professional footballer and I needed to get away from distractions and concentrate 100% on football. That's what Turkey allowed me to do. It was the making of me as a footballer. I feel that was me serving my apprenticeship.\" Ferdinand is a big believer in loans as long as the player himself is in the right mindset. \"People often go on loan and think, 'I'm here for a month. If it doesn't go that well it doesn't matter I'll go back to QPR or Arsenal or Tottenham or wherever. I don't really want to be here anyway…'\" But players need to believe that loan will actually lead somewhere, rather than feeling they are just farmed out. The 22-year-old Ferdinand returned to QPR from Besiktas in 1989 - having scored 19 goals in 30 games - and never looked back. He was one of a generation that also included Ian Wright and Stuart Pearce that made the full journey from non-league to an England shirt. The current crop of Premier League players who have their their roots in non-league - the likes of QPR's Charlie Austin, Burnley's Danny Ings, Dwight Gayle of Crystal Palace, Liverpool's Rickie Lambert and Jamie Vardy of Leicester - prove that the EPPP is not the only way to mould top level players. \"Coming in here to work every day is much better than getting up at 6am, working all day, having to jump on two trains and two buses to get to training,\" Ferdinand adds. \"The boys that come out of non-league appreciate what they have.\" That's another big part of the development issue - today's youngsters in the academy system are so well looked after their hunger can be eroded. \"That's a conversation that has been going on for many, many years,\" says Ferdinand. \"How do we change the mindset of boys that have been brought up in the system because they believe this is life? It is their life. It is what they have got used to. So it's very difficult to tell them about another way when that is all they have seen. \"I know at all clubs education has become a major part of what they do. But it doesn't really give you the life experience. Maybe sending them out to work for a few months, to get up at six in the morning or maybe even earlier to go and do a day's work, might help them to appreciate what they have got.\" Ferdinand laughs at such old-fashioned idealism in the middle of modern, £5bn industry. But it is an interesting idea. Anything and everything needs to be taken into consideration in the hunt for the next batch of Harry Kanes.", "question": "Les Ferdinand is sitting in his office at QPR 's Harlington training @placeholder in his club tracksuit , straight from a stint with the players .", "option_0": "advantage", "option_1": "gathering", "option_2": "center", "option_3": "ground", "option_4": "camp", "label": 3}

{"article": "His suspicious death on 6 June, just days after he vowed to press ahead the fight for universal suffrage, has caused an uproar in Hong Kong, where public opinion has forced the Chinese government to promise to re-open a criminal investigation into his final moments. Mr Li's death at a hospital in the central province of Hunan was initially ruled a suicide, before it was re-classified as an accident. He was reportedly found hanging from the hospital window with a strip of cloth around his neck. But the public, as well as Mr Li's friends and supporters in China, believes the disabled activist, who was in his 60s, may have been murdered because of his politics. His death has special resonance in Hong Kong, where the 1989 Tiananmen Square killings highlighted the former British colony's fears about Chinese rule, and because one of his last interviews was with a Cantonese-language cable television station. \"Each ordinary man has a responsibility for democracy, for the well-being of the nation. For China to enter a democratic society sooner, for China to realise a multi-party political system sooner, I will not look back even if I have to risk my head,\" he was quoted as telling Hong Kong's iCable. Mr Li's supporters doubt whether a fair, objective assessment will be made. That is why volunteers gathered in Hong Kong on Sunday to urge passers-by in the busy commercial district of Mongkok to sign a petition demanding a proper, transparent investigation. A steady stream of people stopped to sign the petition, which has garnered 50,000 signatures. The youngest signatory was five-year-old Christopher, who scribbled his name alongside his mother Coris Leung. \"We are from Hong Kong, but we are also Chinese. I want him to understand our culture, our history and what really happened to this man,\" she said. Don Mak, who describes himself as largely apolitical, said he felt angered and frustrated by Mr Li's death. \"One of the fundamental rights of a human being is the right to live and the right to free speech. He was deprived of both,\" said the 22-year-old university graduate. Volunteers plan to gather 100,000 signatures before presenting the petition to Chinese President Hu Jintao, who is expected to visit Hong Kong at the end of June to celebrate the 15th anniversary of the city's return to China - again highlighting the case's potential sensitivities. Hong Kong is a city split between two political camps: the pan-democrats who are generally critical of the authoritarian rule of the Communist Party in Beijing, and the pro-establishment lawmakers who generally support the central government. But in the Li Wangyang case, the two sides have largely come together to demand accountability. Lee Cheuk-yan, chairman of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China and head of the pan-democratic Labour Party, believes anger from all strata of Hong Kong society has put pressure on the pro-establishment lawmakers. In September, the members of Hong Kong's parliament, called the Legislative Council, will face re-election. All eligible voters are allowed to participate. On 10 June, Mr Lee led 25,000 people on a protest march that culminated in a gathering at Beijing's Liaison Office in western Hong Kong. He said it was the biggest-ever protest at the central government's representative office. Police, who fired tear gas to keep the protesters at bay, said 5,000 people attended the march. \"We protested over the jailing of Ai Weiwei and Chen Guangcheng,\" said Mr Lee, referring to two of China's best-known dissidents. \"But this case is different. This time somebody died. Li Wangyang is obviously a victim of Tiananmen. He was maimed, blinded and made deaf during his imprisonment. His death is a very clear case of the high-handed, tyrannical way the government dealt with a citizen. We are demanding justice.\" Rita Fan, Hong Kong's delegate to the elite Standing Committee in China's parliament, has written to the National People's Congress to express the people's doubts. And over the past week, senior civil servants in the Hong Kong government, from Food and Health Secretary York Chow to Chief Executive Donald Tsang, have made rare public statements saying Mr Li's death was indeed suspicious. Civil servants are meant to be above the political fray, so their comments demonstrate the amount of official support for a thorough investigation. A report last week from the Beijing-backed Hong Kong China News Agency quoted a public security official in Hunan province as saying forensic experts from outside the province had been commissioned to carry out an autopsy. Experienced criminal investigators were also now involved, the spokesman said. But Mr Lee, the pan-democrat lawmaker, said there was widespread doubt on the mainland and in Hong Kong whether the investigation would be effective. Most of the evidence seems to be gone. Mr Li's body was taken away by police just hours after it was found, according to his family and friends. The body was reportedly cremated a few days later on 9 June, against the wishes of the family. It is unclear how, without the body, a new autopsy can be conducted.

{"article": "These geological wonders adorn the Colorado Plateau in the southwestern US - not to mention the desktop wallpapers of countless computers worldwide. By attaching seismometers to the sandstone structures, researchers can measure their modes of resonance. Tracking changes through time could highlight any new weaknesses in the rock that might herald a collapse. There is nothing anyone can do about this - the arches are created and destroyed by erosion. It's the natural order. But an alert to potential danger might be useful to the National Park Service as it manages the many visitors who come to marvel at these imposing forms. \"They're very impressive - global icons that are super-rare, delicate and of course very beautiful,\" says Dr Jeff Moore. The University of Utah researcher is presenting his team's work at the American Geophysical Union's Fall Meeting in San Francisco this week. The group has been attaching a clutch of sensors - not just seismometers, but tiltmeters and temperature probes - to some of the state's most spectacular arches. These include the Landscape, Double-O and Mesa structures. Dr Moore and colleagues are \"listening\" to them ring. The arches are excited by the wind and by natural Earth noise, such as distant ocean waves. What the scientists have found is that each structure has its own characteristic resonance, or modes of resonance. These modes are a function of an arch's material properties - its rock mass and bulk stiffness. \"If something were to change in an arch - like a developing crack - this would be reflected in a change in the vibrational characteristics,\" Dr Moore explained. \"So for Landscape Arch, which is the longest arch in North America at 88m long - we seem to have a fundamental resonant frequency at about 1.8Hz. \"Let's say there was damage on some side of it or internally that we couldn't see - that resonant frequency is expected to drop,\" he told BBC News. Rock falls in 1991 and 1993 mean that Landscape Arch is now out of bounds. Certainly, no-one is allowed to walk on it anymore. What the Utah team has done is develop a non-invasive diagnostic tool to monitor its ongoing status. Its sensors are small and mobile, with the seismometer being just a bit bigger than a coffee mug.  The instruments are placed simply on the surface of the arch for a few hours to allow the vibrations and a few other parameters to be recorded, before the whole suite is then removed. \"The idea is similar to 'wheel-tapping' in old-time train stations, if you like,\" said Dr Moore. \"These guys would tap the steel wheel and if there was a crack, they'd hear that change. \"The field is very well established in civil engineering; it's called structural health monitoring. We're just the first to extend that to natural rock arches.\" There are more than 2,000 arches in Utah's Arches National Park. It has the perfect conditions for their creation. These include a porous sandstone unit that has been juxtaposed atop a very dense one. A salt dome also pushes up from below, which has had the effect of introducing weakness in the overlying rock. This combination of factors initiates a process of erosion that favours undermining and the growth of an arch structure. All it takes are the elements and time. \"We see all stages of arch development, from incipient new formation to collapse,\" Dr Moore told BBC News. \"We had Wall Arch famously collapse in 2008, and Landscape Arch we think is really near the end of its life. \"Double-O, on the other hand, although it is very well formed, it seems to have pretty thick abutments and strong spans.

{"article": "I've often wondered if its tag line, \"we can rebuild him, better than before, stronger....\" was the inspiration for a number of projects on the Labour benches of the Commons in the last Parliament, where teams of MPs toiled to retrofit potential leadership challengers with such qualities as people skills, a sense of humour, policy grasp, or a political cutting edge. With Jeremy Corbyn now secure in the Leader of the Opposition's office, their dreams have come to nothing....but over on the Tory benches I suspect a number of like-minded political engineers are seeking a suitable case for treatment. The Conservative troops expect a Boris vs Amber leadership battle, when the moment comes for Theresa May to make way for the leader who will take them into the next election, but there might well be a wild card....a Macron, if you like. To be sure, the British political system stacks the deck against a Macron-style pop-up political party, but the sight of a leader coming from nowhere to score a stunning electoral triumph attracts political romantics, and fascinates hard boiled professionals. And fresh from their duffing-up in June, the Tory search is on for a middle-ranking minister with perfect teeth, a floppy fringe and a photogenic spouse, who can be moulded into a cyborg warrior capable of doing battle with Jezza. After all, it's not as if this most protean of political parties has not pulled the trick before - John Major was virtually unknown outside Westminster a year before he became prime minister; David Cameron leapt to the Tory leadership on the basis of a good conference speech and a couple of femtoseconds as shadow education secretary after the 2005 election... As Steve Richards writes in his new book, The Rise of the Outsiders: How Mainstream Politics Lost its Way, political outsiders can be a potent force in politics, as Jeremy Corbyn has demonstrated; the Conservative Party does not easily produce such figures, but the manoeuvre pulled off by President Macron to run as an outsider, despite being a quintessential product of the French political establishment, suggests that a gleaming new figure, untainted by years of infighting, can cut through - especially if they are not over-encumbered by ideology and faction. Another key design requirement for the new Tory Terminator will be emotional intelligence - an ability to connect and empathise as effectively as Jeremy Corbyn did, and Theresa May didn't. In the process, some traditional requirements may be watered down; beyond a minimal level of competence, ability as a Commons performer probably matters less these days - and the public may find mastery of its traditional debating style rather suspect and inauthentic. If there is a lesson to take from the last couple of years in politics, it is that what pleases the troops on the green benches of the Chamber seems to leave the country cold. Maverick or mainstream? So who might be in the frame? There are few obvious challengers within the Cabinet, although Priti Patel has her fans. Beyond that there are several middle-ranking figures who might emerge like (and this is all my speculation) Graham Brady, the formidable chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee, or slightly maverick ministers like Rory Stewart, or Jesse Norman. Then, there are current \"outs\" like Grant Shapps or the former chief whip Mark Harper, and a little further down the pecking order there are figures like Tom Tugendhat or Johnny Mercer, who have a sparkle of stardust about them. But they need to be fairly non-factional figures and, I suspect, the winner will be the one who hits upon a position on Brexit that both fits the circumstances as they will be in 2019, or whenever (and who knows what those circumstance will be, it may be more a matter of luck than judgement) and does not alienate a critical mass of MPs. The early symptoms of an embryonic Tory Macron are an interest in refining the party's \"offer\" for the next election, and an attempt to find ways of reaching parts of the electorate who have succumbed to the blandishments of Jeremy Corbyn. They will strike up conversations in the Tea Room or the coffee queue at the Portcullis House. They will be found in earnest conversations with colleagues and be remarkably receptive to invitations to speak on any subject, anytime, anywhere.  Of course, they will be available for media appearances at the drop of a hat. And they're in no hurry. The Tory succession race is going to be a marathon, not a sprint, allowing candidates to hone their offer to MPs and demonstrate their political skills in Commons speeches and questions, in the select committees, at party conference in the TV studios and (but, of course) on social media. And as they pound through the course ahead, factional credentials and Brexit positions will count for a lot, but above all, a bruised and traumatised Conservative Party wants a winner. If you are an MP nursing a fragile majority, nothing matters more than that.

{"article": "It was a routine evening for my wife and son at our new home in the Delhi suburb of Noida. My son was finishing his homework at the dining table, which overlooks the drawing room and the kitchen. At around 21:30, my wife first heard a gentle knock on the door of the kitchen balcony, which became increasingly frantic. When she went to investigate, she saw to her astonishment that a young girl, barely 13, had managed to climb down into my 12th-floor balcony from the flat above with the aid of a cotton sari. Afraid to open the door and let her in, my wife asked her what was wrong. She said she was trying to escape her abusive employers. My wife was reluctant to open the door. She tried unsuccessfully to call the building security. Meanwhile, the girl kept banging on the glass door hysterically, threatening to jump off if she was not let in. My wife told our son to call our neighbours and the building security, while she kept the girl engaged in conversation. Once the neighbours and the guard arrived, the door was opened and the girl was allowed inside the house. She tried to escape, pleading that she be allowed to run away because of the way her employers treated her. My wife did not want to let her go, given the time of night and how unsafe the area could be for a young girl.  By this time the girl's employers had arrived - they told everyone that she was a \"perpetual eloper\", dragged her out of our house and took her away. My family narrated the entire incident to me when I got home soon after. I alerted the other residents though our WhatsApp group. It was soon discovered that the girl was a minor and must have been in great distress to attempt such a dramatic - and dangerous - escape. We sent the security supervisor to the house and the girl was escorted to the building office along with her employers. They said the girl had come to work for them of her own free will. But we were not convinced and called the police. The girl told the police that she had been treated horrifically and alleged that she was not allowed to speak to her family. Arrangements were made for the girl to stay the night with a family in the building. The next morning, police handed her over to an NGO who are in touch with her family. The incident has traumatised my 10-year-old son who cannot stop looking towards the kitchen balcony at least once every five minutes. Of course, the girl is now safe and we feel relieved. But there are countless other girls - and boys - who are in similar exploitative situations in India who need to be rescued.

{"article": "He described it as somebody doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. There are boffins out there who dispute the providence of the quote, ascribing it instead to Benjamin Franklin or Mark Twain or assorted other brain-boxes, but what is unarguable is that the thrust of it is applicable to St Mirren as they meekly make their exit from the top flight of Scottish football. Doing the same thing over and over again means making one dreadful signing after another and expecting things to come right. It means picking the same players and putting them in the same positions where they have failed multiple times before and hoping that things come good. It means replacing one failed manager (Danny Lennon) with his failed assistant (Tommy Craig) and replacing another failed manager (Craig) with his assistant (Gary Teale) and expecting some sort of footballing enlightenment to occur. And it means ignoring the lessons of the past. In seven of the last eight seasons, St Mirren have got to early April - the 32-game stage of the league campaign - in 10th or 11th place in the table - usually 11th. In five of those eight seasons, they had only one club below them at this point of the season. They survived in different ways. They played their way out of trouble on a few occasions, but on others they hung on to their status because there was at least one other club in a worse state - Dunfermline Athletic, Gretna, Inverness Caledonian Thistle, Falkirk, Hamilton Accies, Dundee, Hearts. Any team that continues to flirt with danger is likely to be caught out in the end. St Mirren have had as many lives as a cat in the past decade, but they've run out of time now and it's entirely their own fault. In the last two seasons alone, their business in the transfer market has been largely hopeless. Last season, they brought in Christopher Dilo, a goalkeeper who played 13 matches and then vanished, and Danny Grainger, who played 15 times and was then sent away to Dunfermline. They brought in Greg Wylde, who has been a bit-part player for them - and not a particularly effective bit-part player - and Eric Djemba-Djemba, a colossal embarrassment before disappearing out of Glasgow with his reputation as flat as those caps he used to wear. The names Jake Caprice and Stephane Bahoken are two more that bombed. Of the business done, only Mark Ridgers, the goalkeeper, is still contributing regularly. And this season's incoming list has again been awful. James Marwood was signed and was quickly sent away again, to Forest Green in the English Conference. Ross Caldwell failed and is now with Morton. Isaac Osbourne hasn't played since February. Callum Ball, a striker who got two in 24 games, has been out since January. Yoann Arquin has played nine matches and has two red cards and no goals. Of the summer influx, only Jeroen Tesselaar has appeared in the team on a consistent basis. That's more than a dozen signings - the list is not exhaustive - and only two of them are playing regularly in the team. With a hit-rate like that, no wonder St Mirren are in the state they're in. Look at the teams closest to them at the foot of the table - or, to put it correctly, the teams that are motoring away from them. Motherwell bought wisely in January, bringing in Stephen Pearson to bolster a previously soft-touch midfield, and Scott McDonald who, apart from scoring three goals in six games, offers the type of exuberance in his personality that is like a shot of adrenaline to a one-time beaten dressing-room. Pearson and McDonald have not only elevated Motherwell on the pitch, they have done it off the pitch as well. Their experience and leadership has been a big factor in Motherwell's recovery from apparent doom. Ross County are an even more stark example of a club bringing the right guys in at the right time. Raffaele De Vita has scored three times in eight games, including what turned out to be the winner in their games against Motherwell and Dundee United. Craig Curran has scored five goals in his 13 appearances, including the goal that won a point against Dundee and the decisive goal in their victories over Partick Thistle and Kilmarnock. Where are St Mirren's Pearsons and McDonalds, Da Vitas and Currans? Where are the replacements for the good players they have lost? Conor Newton, Paul Dummett, Paul McGowan and Darren McGregor all exited and those gaps were never filled. It seems like the club's survival policy amounted to hoping against hope that one of their rivals would stumble more often than they did. Motherwell and Ross County went out and improved their lot. St Mirren sat there and waited for one or both of them to mess up. Teale gets the blame, just as Craig got the blame before him, but the real problem here is with Stewart Gilmour and his board and their awful decision-making both in the appointment of two managers who had been part of administrations that had already been deemed not good enough and also by their hapless work in the transfer market. The powers-that-be at St Mirren saw the warning lights flashing a long time ago - or ought to have - and continued doing what they'd always done - the same thing over and over again while expecting a different outcome. It's not nice to see a club relegated - as St Mirren surely will be - but that's what happens when those at the top fall asleep at the wheel. Tony McCoy is nearing the end of his racing career and, although all of us who have marvelled at his genius in the saddle these past two decades will feel flat when he goes, surely the greater emotion will be joy at having been around to witness a maestro in his pomp. I wish I could have appreciated Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier and George Foreman when they were at their best, but I was too young. I wish I'd seen a young Pele play. Or an imperious George Best. What joy it would have been to be able to witness Bobby Jones create history. What a delight it would have been to be of an age to see Barry John or Gareth Edwards up close, week after week. McCoy stands proudly in that pantheon - and it's been a privilege to watch him, interview him and try to understand him and what drove him to those stratospheric heights. Now that his career is turning for home and he's becoming more reflective as opposed to his previous self who only had eyes for Towcester next Tuesday, we're hearing so much from him that is fascinating. \"For me, it's just my own stubbornness and my own peace of mind that drove me to do what I'm doing, retiring,\" he told the Limerick Leader last week. \"I'm not happy about doing it. It is probably the right thing, but what I'm hoping is that people will never be able to say I didn't retire at the top. \"I think you live in fear every day of being not as good as you were. Sometimes the fear totally overrides the enjoyment, you know? \"I don't feel it when I am riding the horses - it's the in-between. It's when it's over. And it's not something that I developed six months or a year ago, it's been there all my life. All my life. Sometimes it has been the ruination of my life.\" McCoy spoke about what was expected of him and how difficult it has been to match those expectations, though, remarkably, he has managed it year after year. He said the biggest problem he has is that he's Tony McCoy and there's a burden that comes with that, a standard he has set for himself that's hard to repeat. \"I'm not bigging myself up for one moment, but I think, if I changed my name, I could carry on riding for another two or three years, no problem,\" he said. He could change his name, but AN Other would be rumbled soon enough. No name change or clever disguise could camouflage his greatness in the saddle. As soon as he won on something that had no right to win, he'd out himself in an instant. \"The sad reality of sport is that, at some point, if you carry on too long, there will be a dip,\" he added. \"And you don't want to be one of the people who had that dip, who carried on too long. That was always my fear.\" McCoy versus his inner-demons? A great battle, no question.

{"article": "Media playback is not supported on this device The Dons almost took a first-half lead when Graeme Shinnie crashed a shot against a post, with Adam Rooney unable to turn in the rebound. The breakthrough came after the break though, Johnny Hayes dispatching Niall McGinn's measured cross. Jamie Walker drew a fine save from Dons keeper Joe Lewis late on as the visitors held on for a deserved win. The win takes Aberdeen within two points of second-placed Rangers in the Premiership, with both sides having played 20 matches. The Ibrox side face rivals Celtic on Saturday. Aberdeen prospered by being assertive and more certain in their attacking play. They set out to isolate Hayes and McGinn on the Hearts full-backs, particularly Liam Smith on the right, and this was a constant source of threat for the visitors in the opening 45 minutes. Hearts' minds seemed scrambled, as much by the effort of the Aberdeen players in pushing up and closing opponents down but also their own lack of composure. There was no spell of Hearts possession, as their midfield three saw the game pass them by. Most of the Aberdeen chances came from their flank, with McGinn's cross reaching Kenny McLean, whose header was pushed away by Hearts goalkeeper Jack Hamilton. The goalkeeper had already been relieved when Mark Reynolds headed wide from close range, and he later had to clear frantically when the ball spun off his teammate Faycal Rherras inside the six yard box. Hearts head coach Ian Cathro tried to alter the flow of the game, bringing Arnaud Djoum deeper and wide, but Aberdeen's central midfielders also imposed themselves and Shinnie rattled a shot off the upright from 20 yards. The play was more even-handed after the break, with Krystian Nowak essentially playing as a third centre-back for Hearts instead of a holding midfielder, and so encouraging Smith and Rherras to push further forward on the flanks, when they could afford to. It was a measure of the game's dynamic that Hearts' first corner came two minutes into the second half, when Aberdeen had already registered five. Aberdeen still carried the greater threat, and Shay Logan saw an effort from the edge of the area deflected wide. Hearts' reorganisation stemmed some of Aberdeen's dominance, but not their edge. McGinn and Hayes continued to seek every channel of space to breach the Hearts defence, and when the former surged down the right and whipped the ball across the six yard box, the latter charged in to convert at the back post. The sense was of one side being sure of its strengths and its game plan, and the other still being a work in progress. That will not offer much relief for Cathro, even if he will hope to build a team that better represents his values during the winter break and January transfer window. It will be no surprise, for instance, if two new full-backs are sought. His key players were mostly marginal, and Djoum was replaced during the second half. Walker remained the most effective, and a spin and shot inside the area drew a good save from Aberdeen goalkeeper Lewis. Even so, it was the visitors who were the more assertive, more imposing side. With some more composure and sharper instincts inside the area from Rooney, they would have won the game more comfortably. The display, and the result, emphasised that, for now, it is Aberdeen who are the more fully-formed and capable team, and the likelier to challenge for second place in the Premiership. Hearts manager Ian Cathro: \"Initially, we lost the fight to make the game the way that we wanted it to be. It was difficult for us to get started and the game became closer to what Aberdeen wanted. \"In the second half, with a couple of adjustments, we became a little bit stronger, a better structure and we were able to play more often. A combination of not generating enough chances and some mistakes defensively resulted in us losing the game. \"We wanted the game to be more open with more possession and more control than direct, wide, foul, free-kick, those sorts of things. I don't have any question about the willingness of the players to fight and they deserve credit for getting through the first-half, which was difficult. \"My Hearts team will always play in a way which I think the players here can play. Will we look to add players of a different type to the squad? Yes, but that will be work through the January transfer window.\" Media playback is not supported on this device Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes: \"We were guilty of missing chances. It was fiercely contested, but there were good moments of play from us. Once we did play in the final third, we created more than one or two opportunities. \"Everybody talks about the Tynecastle atmosphere but when the Hearts team goes off to boos at half time, you say that's part of the job done but we need to crank it up more. \"I'm delighted that Johnny Hayes was on the end of that and scored. There's no doubt in my mind that we were the better team, we were tidy, making good decisions when to play and when to hold things on, and recognising the strengths of the Hearts team. \"Maybe some sort of criticism on me is being over reliant on the same team and that fatigue and demands on them, so hopefully with people pushing and one or two things happening in January, we can look forward to a strong finish to the season.\" Match ends, Heart of Midlothian 0, Aberdeen 1.

{"article": "Ms Rudd said the British had wanted to control the flow of information to \"keep the element of surprise\". She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme she had been very clear with Washington \"that it should not happen again\". Ms Rudd said the Manchester-born bomber Salman Abedi had already been on the radar of the British security services. She claimed the 22-year-old, born to parents of Libyan origin, \"was known up to a point\" in the UK. Ms Rudd spoke out as the government raised the terrorism threat level to \"critical\" - the highest possible rating - on Tuesday amid fears another attack was imminent. She said this meant the police would have 3,800 soldiers to call on and equipment for \"as long as we need them\". The measures follow Monday night's attack at Manchester Arena, which killed 22 and injured 59. Counter-terrorism detectives have spoken in the past about how important it sometimes is for them that names of suspects do not make it into the media. They say a delay of around 36 hours, before the public know who they are investigating can allow them to arrest known associates of the suspect before they know police are looking for them. Information about the bomber's identity first emerged in the US - with American TV networks CBS and NBC naming Abedi as the suspect. Ms Rudd was asked whether she would be looking at how information sharing may have resulted in the premature release of details the British police and security services had not wanted in the public domain. The home secretary told Today: \"Yes, quite frankly. \"The British police have been very clear they want to control the flow of information in order to protect operational integrity - the element of surprise - so it is irritating if it gets released from other sources, and I've been very clear with our friends that that should not happen again.\" Pressed on whether the Americans had compromised the investigation, she said: \"I wouldn't go that far, but I can say they are perfectly clear about the situation and that it shouldn't happen again.\" BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said Ms Rudd's irritation stemmed from the fact \"crucial information about the investigation\" had been \"leaked to the media in the US\". She had been concerned that this \"might have compromised aspects of the investigation\", namely that it may have \"alerted associates\" of the bomber \"that the security forces here knew who they were looking for\". He added: \"Ms Rudd, I'm told, got on the blower to US officials and gave them a piece of her mind.

BBC Election Live: Rolling text and video updates Theresa May denies social care U-turn Conservative manifesto: At-a-glance Conservative manifesto Mr Osborne was critical of the Tory plan, originally included in the party's election manifesto, to pay for social care by taking funds from the recipient's estate after death, down to a cut-off point of Â£100,000. The party has since promised to cap the amount taken from an estate, after facing a barrage of criticism. Mr Osborne said the plans were \"were clearly badly thought through, because the prime minister herself decided to rethink them.\" He also defended an Evening Standard headline denouncing Mrs May's pledge to get annual net migration below 100,000 as \"politically rash and economically illiterate\". \"The Evening Standard is saying `You have got a promise to reduce immigration so tell us how you are going to do it. \"Which section of industry is not going to have the labour it currently needs?

But he said the paper would not pull its punches. \"What the paper is doing is standing up for a set of values that the paper has long espoused and by a happy coincidence are also the values I applied as chancellor.\" He said Mrs May had taken the party in a sharply different direction since taking over from Mr Cameron, who resigned after losing the EU referendum last year. \"Both Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn are offering, in very different ways, a retreat from international liberalism and globalisation. \"That is quite a development in British politics, and I think there are quite a lot of people who are uncertain whether that is the right development and I want to make sure that the Evening Standard is asking on their behalf questions about that.\" Mr Osborne told presenter Nick Robinson he was not missing front line politics. \"I'm really enjoying covering the campaign as an editor.

{"article": "Tests at Guanabara Bay have revealed high levels of bacteria and viruses coming from human sewage. Two sailors contracted infections at a test event in August, which they claim were caused by the waters. Rio Olympic organisers said earlier this month that the health and safety of athletes is \"always a top priority\". Seven of the 10 sailing events in the Brazilian city will launch into the Marina de Gloria, where the new pipeline is due to open this month. \"The Marina area is our biggest challenge; it's critical it's completed and we start seeing a difference,\" World Sailing's head of events Alastair Fox told BBC Sport. \"It's essential that it improves radically - from a health point of view and also for showcasing the sport.\" Nearly 70% of sewage in Rio is spilled raw into its surrounding waters. Sailors have also reported seeing pollution, including furniture and floating animal carcasses, while drug-resistant \"super-bacteria\" were found in the area last December. A statement from the Rio 2016 organising committee earlier this month said: \"There is no doubt water within the field of play meets the relevant standards.\" The Games begin on 5 August. Following the test event at Guanabara Bay in August, German sailor Erik Heil and South Korean windsurfer Wonwoo Cho both attributed their illnesses to the water quality. However, World Sailing says the 8% illness rate at the event was lower than average for regattas. It also says doctors feel those illnesses could have been prevented, and believes athletes can minimise the risks by following hygiene guidelines, such as taking showers after exiting the water. British two-time Olympic champion Sarah Gosling, now the athletes' representative on the World Sailing council, believes the pursuit of Olympic gold will outweigh any risks involved in the minds of competitors. \"Winning a gold medal will make up for anything - it's really not that relevant,\" Gosling told the Associated Press on Tuesday. \"There are plenty and plenty of reports out there about athletes who their whole life is about winning medals, and anything that happens on the way is kind of irrelevant. \"For sailing to be in the centre of the Olympics right there, for athletes to be able to stay in the village, to be able to go to the opening and closing ceremony, it's a massive deal.\" World Sailing has had reports the rubbish in the water at Guanabara Bay, where Marina de Gloria opens into, is higher than usual because of rainy season deluges washing items into it. Fox will conduct the latest site visit in late January to assess progress. \"We're doing as much as we can to work with the Rio authorities,\" he said, adding World Sailing also had back-up plans to treat the water should the work not be completed. \"When racing near a big city, water quality is always an issue. We've no intention of not holding the competition there.

{"article": "Despite being newly elected, Jeane Freeman has more political experience than many of her fellow MSPs. She served as a senior advisor to First Minister Jack McConnell, and has also served on the Scottish Police Services Authority Board and the Judicial Appointments Board for Scotland and chaired the the National waiting Times Centre board. Ms Freeman helped found the Women for Independence movement during the 2014 referendum campaign, and has now won the Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley seat with a majority of over 6,000. She said: \"I'm excited and a bit nervous. It's one thing to have worked in the parliament before, it's quite another to be here as an MSP. Not so much finding my way around, more getting my head around all the arrangements and getting my feet under the table. \"I'm delighted to be here, it's a huge privilege, and I'm looking forward to beginning the work to represent the people of Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley.\" Oliver Mundell's may be a fresh face at Holyrood, but it's a rather familiar one - given the family resemblance with his father David Mundell, once a Tory MSP and now the Scottish Secretary. Mr Mundell Jr took the hotly-contested constituency of Dumfriesshire, which had been Labour's safest seat in 2011 but developed into a close fight between the Tories and the SNP. He said: \"I walked into the count thinking we had a chance, because we'd fought a really effective local campaign and a lot of voters were coming over to support us in the final days of the campaign, but it wasn't ballots were all bundled up on the table that we knew we'd got over the line.\" Mr Mundell said his father had advised him to enjoy his first days at Holyrood, but to \"take stock before throwing myself too much into things on day one\". He added: \"I'm feeling quite confident, but its a mix of excitement and nerves on the first day.\" Daniel Johnson was one of Scottish Labour's few success stories on election night, having taken Edinburgh Southern from SNP incumbent Jim Eadie. Labour had targeted the seat as a key battleground, with leader Kezia Dugdale out on the streets alongside Mr Johnson on the first and last days of the campaign. He said arriving at Holyrood was like \"the first day at school\". Mr Johnson said: \"What I'm keen to do is build a link between people and politics - we need to put people right at the heart of politics. \"Over the last few years politics has got very noisy, it's all been about the big constitutional things. It needs to get back to real people. \"The Scottish Parliament was founded on the principle that it was about bringing politics closer to people, and that's what I want to focus on.\" Ross Greer has become Scotland's youngest-ever MSP at the age of 21. The West of Scotland list MSP had just started a psychology degree at university when he landed a full-time job with the Yes Scotland campaign during the 2014 independence referendum. He said: \"I put uni on pause for that, and I'm obviously having to put it on pause a wee bit longer. I'll probably go back eventually, but I've had a fair bit of political experience already and an opportunity I couldn't pass up.\" Mr Greer said there was an \"overwhelming sense of relief\" when he was elected, and says he and his Green MSPs now \"hold the balance of power\" at Holyrood. He said: \"No-one was really expecting the plot twist of the SNP to have a minority and the Greens to end up with the balance of power, so it's looking like a pretty exciting start to a pretty great five years. \"The opportunity I've got is proving that young people aren't just 'the future', as part of some silly cliche, that we're here now and we're an important part of the decision making process. I hope I can prove to other young people that they should get involved in politics as early as possible.\" Alex Cole-Hamilton has been seeking election for the Lib Dems for over a decade - he was even featured on the front cover of the party's 2003 Holyrood manifesto. Having triumphed in Edinburgh Western, a seat taken from the SNP, Mr Cole-Hamilton said he was looking forward to \"getting stuck in\". He said: \"This is a place that I've wanted to be for a long time. It's great to be here. \"Without an overall majority, the SNP can beheld to account, we can meaningfully scrutinise legislation, which arguably we didn't have in the last parliament. \"I think that means the role of opposition politicians is going to be far more important in this session.\" Holyrood also has a new father-daughter team - albeit on different sides of the chamber. John Finnie's daughter Ruth Maguire has won a seat in Cunninghame South for the SNP - the party Mr Finnie quit last term for the Greens. Mr Finnie said: \"We'll never fall out - we'll have differences. We'll probably just never talk about politics in great detail. \"The public expect parliamentarians to work together, we hope that there'll be joint working not just in the committees but also in the chamber.\" Ms Maguire added: \"I have asked him not to embarrass me, or do any embarrassing dad stuff. I was horrified to find out he's only a few doors down from me in the corridor.

{"article": "Across the 18 satellites now in orbit, nine clocks have stopped operating. Three are traditional rubidium devices; six are the more precise hydrogen maser instruments that were designed to give Galileo superior performance to the American GPS network. Galileo was declared up and running in December. However, it is still short of the number of satellites considered to represent a fully functioning constellation, and a decision must now be made about whether to suspend the launch of further spacecraft while the issue is investigated. Prof Jan Woerner, the director general of the European Space Agency (Esa), told a meeting with reporters: \"Everybody is raising this question: should we postpone the next launch until we find the root cause, or should we launch? \"You can give both answers at the same time. You can say we wait until we find the solution but that means if more clocks fail we will reduce the capability of Galileo. But if we launch we will at least maintain if not increase the [capability], but we may then take the risk that a systematic problem is not considered. We are right now in this discussion about what to do.\" Each Galileo satellite carries two rubidium and two hydrogen maser clocks. The multiple installation enables a satellite to keep working after an initial failure. All 18 spacecraft currently in space continue to operate, but one of them is now down to just two clocks. Most of the maser failures (5) have occurred on the satellites that were originally sent into orbit to validate the system, whereas all three rubidium stoppages are on the spacecraft that were subsequently launched to fill out the network. Esa staff at its technical centre, ESTEC, in the Netherlands are trying to isolate the cause the of failures - with the assistance of the clock (Spectratime of Switzerland) and satellite manufacturers (Airbus and Thales Alenia Space; OHB and SSTL). It is understood engineers have managed to restart another hydrogen clock that had stopped. Esa is also in contact with the Indian space agency which is using the same clocks in its sat-nav system. So far, the Indians have not experienced the same failures. A statement issued by the agency late on Wednesday gave additional details. It appears the rubidium failures \"all seem to have a consistent signature, linked to probable short circuits, and possibly a particular test procedure performed on the ground\". The maser clock failures are said to be better understood, with two likely causes, the second of which has caused most grief. The Esa statement said this second scenario was \"related to the fact that when some healthy [hydrogen maser] clocks are turned off for long periods, they do not restart due to a change in clock characteristics\". Actions are being taken to try to prevent further problems. These involve changing the way clocks are operated in orbit. Clocks about to fly are also likely to be refurbished, and future devices yet to be made will have design changes, the agency says. Esa is hopeful it can still launch the next four satellites in the constellation before the end of the year. Precise timing is at the core of all satellite-navigation systems. Atomic clocks generate the time code that is continuously transmitted to users on the ground to help them fix a position. The passive hydrogen maser clocks in Galileo are determined to be accurate to one billionth of a second per day, or one second in three million years. This performance ought to contribute to giving users fixes that have errors of a metre or less - significantly better than the standard open service from GPS. A fully operational Galileo system is regarded as a constellation of 24, split across three orbital planes in the sky. But spares are required also, and with one very early satellite in the constellation already considered very close to complete failure - for different reasons - there needs to be near-continuous production of spacecraft. The four latest satellites went up as a quartet in November; more are set to follow later this year. Galileo is a project of the European Commission, the EU's executive branch. The EC employs Esa as its technical and procurement agent. The development path to a \"European GPS\" has been a tortuous one. The project is years late, and the completion cost - expected to be some 7bn euros by 2020 - is substantially higher than that originally foreseen by EU member states.

{"article": "Having secured their Premier League survival with a match to spare, Swansea City appear to have embraced that notion in quite a literal sense this week. Their reprieve from relegation was confirmed when Hull were thrashed by Crystal Palace on Sunday and, after toasting the occasion at home, the Swans' players decided to take their celebrations further afield by spontaneously booking a two-night trip to Ibiza. Head coach Paul Clement then received a text message from an unnamed player, who said he was acting on behalf of the squad when he asked for permission to visit the Balearic island famous for its nightlife. Clement was happy to oblige but, with their final Premier League game at home to West Brom on Sunday, there were certain conditions. \"They would have tried to have come back on Saturday if they could, but I told them to be back on Wednesday,\" says Clement. \"I think they had a good time, almost the whole squad went. They were alright. They've already had one session and we have got three more.\" Was the 45-year-old former Bayern Munich assistant manager tempted to join them? \"No, not at all,\" he laughs. \"Well, I couldn't keep up with those young guys at all. \"I just said they had to be back on time, 1.30 on Wednesday and they were coming in the door right on 1.30.\" Clement believes the fact the vast majority of the Swansea squad chose to go on the trip to Ibiza was evidence of their team spirit, one of the \"standout features\" of their escape from relegation. When Clement succeeded Bob Bradley in January, the Swans were bottom of the Premier League table with just 12 points from 19 games. But since appointing Carlo Ancelotti's former assistant at Real Madrid and Paris St-Germain, Swansea have turned their season around with 26 points from their subsequent 18 fixtures. It is a remarkable transformation, and not the first time a member of the Clement family has helped a team retain their top-flight status in dramatic fashion. Clement's brother Neil was a part of the West Brom side who survived at the end of the 2004-05 season despite being bottom of the table at Christmas and at the start of the final day of the campaign. \"The big difference is they were bottom on the last day of the season. They had to close the gap, but got that result and stayed up,\" the Swans boss says. \"There were parallels. Someone asked me the other day that if there is ever a team bottom of the Premier League at Christmas then you need to hire a Clement. \"Either coach or player, then you have got half a chance.\" As proud as Clement is of Swansea's survival, he is equally eager they avoid such a stressful battle to avoid the drop next season. If they continue to languish in the lower reaches of the Premier League table, Clement is concerned they may eventually drop back down to the Championship. \"Exactly, Sunderland flirted with it too many years and paid the price,\" he says. \"We have to be much stronger, to do that we need a good pre-season to evaluate the squad, where we need to strengthen. \"I don't think we necessarily need as much as we did in January. We want key players who can come in and make a difference. Like the players we had. \"We need to start strongly and get as many points as possible in the first half of the season, like West Brom have done this season. \"If you can then finish like we have done, we will find ourselves in a strong position.\"", "question": "It is a well - worn trope that teams with little to play for at the end of the season are ' on the @placeholder ' , coasting through their last few games with their thoughts already turning to upcoming holidays .", "option_0": "earth", "option_1": "verge", "option_2": "island", "option_3": "beach", "option_4": "word", "label": 3}
{"article": "He was born William Jefferson Blythe in Hope, Arkansas, on 19 August 1946. His father had died in a car accident three months earlier. When he was four, his mother married a used car dealer called Roger Clinton. His stepfather was an alcoholic who beat his wife. At the age of 14, the young Bill Clinton warned him to stop. In the early 1960s, he met his political hero, former President John F Kennedy, in the White House Rose Garden. Parallels between the two men would be drawn many times during the following years. After studying at Georgetown University, Bill Clinton spent two years at Oxford University. It was here that he admitted smoking - but not inhaling - marijuana. A supporter of civil rights and a campaigner against the Vietnam war, he took steps to ensure that he would not have to serve in it. Later, his critics would use the episode to question Mr Clinton's patriotism and character. After graduating in law from Yale in 1973, he returned to Arkansas to teach law and enter politics. Defeated for Congress in 1974, a year later he married Hillary Rodham, an ambitious young lawyer whom he had met while at Yale. Their daughter Chelsea was born in 1980. Elected Arkansas' attorney general in 1976, Mr Clinton won the governorship of the state two years later. The astute scholar had become a political high-flyer at the tender age of 32. Losing the governorship in 1982, he regained it in 1986 and held it until his election to the White House in 1992. Mr Clinton's campaign against the incumbent President George H W Bush was almost derailed before it started. A nightclub singer named Gennifer Flowers alleged he was her former lover. With the evasive manner which was to become a hallmark of his presidency, the Clintons went on national television and professed their love for one another while not directly denying Gennifer Flowers' claims. A popular mood for change swept Mr Clinton and his running mate, Al Gore, into the White House. He committed the government to reduce the deficit and reform the US healthcare system. The latter was entrusted to the First Lady, but her recommendations were so unwieldy and unpopular that they had to be scrapped. The Clinton presidency was stumbling, amidst the stirrings of a scandal. Whitewater, an Arkansas property company partly owned by the Clintons, was investigated for financial malpractice while the Clintons were in the Arkansas governor's mansion. There was also the apparent suicide of a deputy White House counsel and close friend of the Clintons from Arkansas, Vince Foster. In July 1993, Foster was found dead in his car in a Washington park. A gun was at his side. The Clintons mourned their friend, but suspicion about the manner of his death and the Whitewater affair would never be far from the presidency. In September 1993, in a remarkable ceremony on the White House lawn, Israel's Prime Minister, Yitzhak Rabin, and the Palestine Liberation Organisation's Yasser Arafat, shook hands after signing a peace deal. Mr Clinton, who had nurtured and engineered the treaty, basked in the glow of a diplomatic coup. Rabin's death, two years later, was a shocking blow. At home, he presided over an economic boom, with cuts in the deficit accompanied by reductions in unemployment. In November 1995, Mr Clinton became the first US president to visit Northern Ireland. Throughout his tenure, he committed himself to bringing peace to the province. He sponsored the process which culminated in the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, brokered by his nominee and political colleague, George Mitchell. A crushing defeat of the Democrats at the 1994 congressional elections, for which he took the blame, was not enough to prevent Mr Clinton from being elected again in 1996. He was, simply, the slickest political operator in town. But Mr Clinton's second term was tarnished by scandal. Another woman, Paula Jones, pursued a claim for sexual harassment against the president. During the case, a former White House intern was called to give evidence. Her name: Monica Lewinsky. Both she and the president testified that they had not had a sexual relationship. Further examination revealed that they had both lied under oath. The way was clear for Mr Clinton's opponents in Congress to impeach him. Though they were unsuccessful, the sight of the president having his private life raked over for weeks in the full glare of the Congressional spotlight was demeaning to both the man and the office he held. His final two years in office saw Mr Clinton struggling with his reputation as a womaniser. His wife, Hillary, now entered public life in her own right, winning a US Senate seat in New York state in November 2000. His Vice-President, Al Gore, controversially lost the closest presidential election in living memory at the same time. But Mr Clinton's popularity was still such that, barring the legal impossibility of standing for president for a third time in 2000, he would probably have beaten off the challenge of George W Bush. Since leaving office, Mr Clinton has travelled the world, effortlessly charming crowds wherever he goes. He stopped traffic in London's Piccadilly and drew vast numbers of admirers in Belfast. He also set up the William J Clinton Foundation to promote and address international humanitarian causes such as treatment and prevention of HIV/Aids and global warming. In 2005 he founded the Clinton Global Initiative, engaging world leaders in development initiatives of global concern. In 2004, his much-vaunted memoirs were published. The huge volume, more than 950 pages long, was panned by many critics as being overwritten yet lacking depth. Even so, the revelations about the Lewinsky affair, after which he said he was \"in the doghouse\", and when his wife considered leaving him, made My Life, as the book was called, a worldwide best-seller. Known for his love of fast-food during his time in the White House, Mr Clinton underwent quadruple-bypass surgery in September 2004 after experiencing chest pains. And in February 2010, he underwent a minor heart procedure in New York, after complaining of discomfort in his chest. But he has not let any worries about his health slacken his work rate. In August 2009, Mr Clinton made a dramatic flight to North Korea, in a bid to release two US journalists who had been arrested the previous March after allegedly entering the secretive country illegally. After his talks with North Korea's reclusive leader, Kim Jong-il, it was announced that the reporters had been pardoned and they were allowed to fly back to the US with the former President. At the same time, Mr Clinton took up the role of UN special envoy to Haiti. Since an earthquake devastated the Caribbean nation in January 2010, he has worked tirelessly to help the relief effort.

They say the waste will be quickly diluted, but have advised people not to touch the water while the dump takes place.

{"article": "In two famous - and famously lengthy - experiments, scientists wait for pitch to drip from a funnel. It happens about once a decade, because pitch is a substance so viscous that it is, to all intents and purposes, a solid. Lives have come and gone while the drops went undripped, or fell unwitnessed. Recently, a student project in London picked up the pace, using slightly runnier pitch in a similar set-up. The invisible, inevitable progress of these inky half-fluids has captured the public's attention; the drops have acquired meaning and drama. But alongside the storytelling, Dr Kostya Trachenko is adamant there are important measurements to be made. He and his undergraduate students at Queen Mary University of London put their pitch into five different funnels, with different sized openings. Pitch, or bitumen, is the black muck left over from distilling crude oil, and can also be produced by heating wood. It is a liquid at high temperatures but becomes very hard when it cools down, which makes it useful in waterproofing and road surfacing. At normal room temperature, in fact, a lump of pitch can be shattered with a hammer. \"We convincingly saw that it behaves like a liquid,\" Dr Trachenko says as he shows me the set-up, clearly proud of his students' work. \"And we were also able to quantify it - because in physics it's important to attach a number to the process.\" As you would predict for a liquid, the bigger openings let more pitch through: almost 53g over the course of a year for the widest (6mm), compared to 5g for the narrowest (2.5mm). This rate is positively heart-stopping by comparison with the best-known experiment of this kind, which began in Brisbane, Australia, in 1927. There, at the University of Queensland, Prof Thomas Parnell let some pitch solidify in the top of a funnel - and waited. Prof Parnell, a Cambridge graduate and veteran of World War One, wanted to show his students that if you watched it for long enough, it would still flow like a liquid. It was a long wait. The funnel dripped its first drop in 1938 and only eight more have fallen since. In 1961, just three drops later, a new lecturer called John Mainstone adopted the experiment after a colleague pointed it out, gathering dust in a cupboard. He eventually persuaded the university to put it on display and the drops became talking points. Prof Mainstone, however, never saw the pitch in motion. In 1979, the sixth drop went on a weekend. In 1988, with the experiment proudly displayed at Brisbane's World Expo, Prof Mainstone was fetching a drink when the seventh drop fell. By 2000, a video camera had been set up to capture drop number eight, but it malfunctioned at the crucial moment. When the ninth drop fell in April this year it was watched by three webcams and thousands of online enthusiasts - but not by Prof Mainstone, who died eight months earlier at the age of 78. The Queensland experiment itself was pipped to the post of posterity in July 2013, when another long-standing funnel of pitch became the first to drip a drop in public. At Trinity College Dublin, a very similar set-up dating from 1944 was filmed as it shed a black blob into its own beaker, offering the first ever glimpse of such an event taking place. Dr Shane Bergin, a physicist and senior research fellow at Trinity, explains that it was the feeling of suspense in the Brisbane story that rekindled interest in the Dublin drop. \"Eventually, when our one was caught on camera, it provided the world with a kind of scientific 'Aaaah' moment,\" he says. \"As in, finally, we see it! \"In a world where we expect to expect things to happen very quickly, and stuff is demanded of us instantaneously, it's a little quirky to think that a lot of stuff just happens on a time scale that's much slower than we can normally appreciate.\" All this drawn-out drama could be accelerated, of course, if the pitch was warmed up. Pitch is one of a group of substances called \"glasses\" which, when cooled, become hard and solid-seeming, despite maintaining the jumbled molecular structure of a liquid. There is no obvious shift to a more rigid, crystalline organisation of molecules, which happens when water and other liquids freeze. Glasses just get steadily slower and stiffer as the temperature drops. So the famous experiments, Dr Trachenko insists, could be made even drearier. \"If you put it in the fridge, it would take thousands of years,\"  he points out, with a dry smile. \"For a theorist like myself, 70 years is actually not that long.\" Window glass belongs in the same category, but debate has raged for years among physicists as to whether solid glass in fact represents a different \"phase\" of matter. Dr Trachenko believes that all of the pitch drop results, including those of his students' project, are important evidence to the contrary. \"Even though glass is a familiar system, explaining how it forms is a big deal in modern physics research,\" he says. \"Once we assume that the behaviour is essentially liquid-like... we can come up with equations to predict how long it would take for solid glass to flow, even though we would never ever see it.\" Dr Trachenko is firmly in the camp that sees glass as \"merely a very viscous liquid\" and has published calculations and models in support of that view, based on the way it absorbs heat and behaves under pressure. The popular myth, however, that ancient windows are thicker at the bottom because the glass has sagged with the centuries, is wide of the mark. They have thicker edges because they were made that way, Dr Trachenko is quick to explain. To see glass flow would take an almost unimaginably long time, he says - but it would happen. \"If you wait longer than the age of the universe, you'll see this as a liquid.\" Dr Trachenko taps the glass cabinet that houses his students' pitch funnels. \"It would flow. And that would be the end of it.\" That is a long wait to win an argument. In the meantime, he relies on maths. \"For physicists, one billion years is not much different from one second. It's just a number. It's an extremely long number, but I can quantify the process.\" And to go with the numbers, he now has observations from the dribbles of bitumen inside the cabinet. Their comparatively speedy flow, with multiple drips from multiple funnels, allowed Dr Trachenko's students to calculate - and publish - the average \"viscosity\" of their pitch, measured in units called pascal-seconds. (About eight million pascal-seconds, to be precise.) By that measure, they estimate it is thirty times runnier than the pitch used in Queensland, a million times runnier than glass, and a hundred billion times thicker than water. Relative runniness can be important. A recently rediscovered pitch drop experiment at Aberystwyth University in Wales actually predates the famous Queensland funnel by 13 years - but its pitch is stiffer and has never yielded a single drop. In fact, it has barely entered the stem of the funnel and is unlikely to bear fruit for at least 1,300 years. The Hunterian Museum at the University of Glasgow, meanwhile, contains two remarkable demonstrations set up in the 1800s by renowned physicist Lord Kelvin. Intrigued by some of the same questions as Drs Parnell, Mainstone and Trachenko, Kelvin placed bullets on top of a dish of hard, black pitch, and corks at the bottom: over time, the bullets sank and the corks floated. Lord Kelvin also showed that the flow of pitch is genuinely glacial, with a mahogany ramp that allowed it to slide imperceptibly downward and form similar shapes and patterns to rivers of ice in the Alps. The inexorable intrigue of these experiments exerts an obvious pull on our imagination. \"People are genuinely curious,\" says Dr Bergin from Dublin, where the Trinity College pitch drop is slated to be moved into a public exhibition space.  \"We want to use it as a hook to show that physics tries to understand the universe, from the nitty gritty to the super duper, and all of the wacky stuff that's in there as well. \"We're going to start a new, bigger pitch drop here in Trinity as well. We figured, why not?\" Back in London, Dr Trachenko similarly loves the idea of challenging the intuitions of his students - and the public. \"It reminds people that the physical world is not about us,\" he says. \"We are just passers-by.\" But he also maintains that there are real findings to be made. Modelling how materials like glass behave in the longest of long terms, Dr Trachenko says, could help plan for the safe disposal of nuclear waste that takes millions of years to decay. \"That's not an experiment you can check in the lab.\" He is clearly not finished with pitch - nor with his students. \"There are two jars on my shelf,\" he says with a hint of mischief. \"The second one is more viscous.\" As soon as the fastest flowing funnel in his current set-up is empty, Dr Trachenko is obviously itching to test out the even stickier stuff. He guesses that the next crop of students might need the entire length of their degree to get results. \"If they measure the viscosity of that one, then maybe they can hope for an extra grade.\" And if they learn from history as well as physics, his students will be checking their camera twice.", "question": "Life is speeding up .

One family reportedly lived off grass during a four-day escape bid. As the Iraqi army and allied forces, backed by coalition air strikes, attempt to recapture the city, aid agencies say Falluja's residents - as many as 50,000 people - have no safe routes out and are likely to be caught in the crossfire. \"Food and medicines are in extremely short supply in the city. Some families have been going through garbage for food,\" the UN refugee agency's Caroline Gluck in Baghdad told the BBC. \"Some people were so desperate that they committed suicide. Children are showing signs of trauma, they're clearly terrified.\" Baahjet Ibrahim, an imam who has escaped and is in a refugee camp in Barzinjah, told the BBC: \"Those who are inside cannot leave and those who are outside cannot help them. \"There is no food at all. A sack of flour costs a million dinars ($850, Â£580) and more. \"We demand that the security forces act with professionalism and dignity, like all the armies in the world, to let people escape, to receive and respect them, because there are children, elderly and sick people among them,\" Mr Ibrahim said. Escape from the city is fraught with dangers, those who have managed to flee say. \"[Civilians] have survived on dried dates and hot water from the river,\" says Becky Bakr Abdullah of the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC). \"They also tell me about an extremely dangerous escape where they have run in groups of 15 to 16 families, often barefoot, during the night carrying the elderly and sick with children. \"Along the way they have had to hide in big drainage pipes and raise white flags in order not to be shot at. Ms Gluck says the UNHCR was told of a family of six who \"spent four days hiding in a river, escaping from IS, waiting to be collected by the security forces, and they were forced to eat grass.\" \"It's very clear that people are taking extreme risks in order to leave Falluja but it underlines how desperate their situation has become,\" she added. A hotline has been set up for the civilians in Falluja who want army assistance to leave - but air strikes continue, fighting is expected to intensify, and IS threatens to kill those who try to escape. The NRC says it believes that just one family has escaped from the city in the past nine days. \"A human catastrophe is unfolding in Fallujah. Families are caught in the crossfire with no safe way out,\" says NRC Secretary General Jan Egeland. Foreign humanitarian organisations are unable to enter Falluja.

Ms Abdulla said the families she has met speak of \"an extremely dire situation\". \"There are mainly two reasons for why people don't escape,\" she told the BBC World Service. \"One is because they are obviously extremely afraid. There are bombs and rockets and shootings right outside their doorstep so people have stopped even moving outside their houses. \"The other reason is, and this was a mother of three who told me this, when rumours got out that their family wanted to escape, IS came to their door, started beating up their men and started threatening the family's lives.\" Faiq Ismali fled Falluja and is living in Barzinjah camp.

According to the RAC, the busiest day overall will be Monday, with about five million cars on the roads for \"leisure trips\" as people either go for days out - or return from a weekend away. This is double the number the RAC expected to see on Thursday following a survey of motorists' plans for the weekend. The busiest roads are expected to be the M5 towards Exeter; the M6 and then A590 around the Lake District; the M3 towards Bournemouth and the M1 north from London. RAC spokesman Rod Dennis said: \"While summer appears to have taken a leave of absence for many of us, our figures suggest drivers are undeterred and are still keen to make the most of the long weekend to spend time with friends and family in the UK. \"We recommend motorists wanting to beat the queues travel outside peak times... try to get away in good time if you are planning a day trip on Monday, or face a long journey home at the end of a summer holiday.\" Most roadworks on motorways were removed by 06:00 BST on Friday. Highways England, which manages the motorway network, said it would lift or complete about 98% of all work before the bank holiday, freeing up 445 miles of roads. Those that have stayed in place cannot be removed for safety reasons, the organisation said. 26 miles A1 J51 (Leeming) to J56 (Barton) 20 miles M6 J16 to J19 near Crewe 17 miles M1 J19 to J16 near Crick 10 miles M60 J 12 to J18 near Manchester 9 miles M62 J10 near Warrington 9 miles M62 J18 to J20 near Manchester Rail engineering works are taking place over the weekend. Francis Paonessa, managing director for infrastructure projects at Network Rail, said: \"While our massive investment programme impacts comparatively small parts of the network, on some routes its impact is significant, particularly major routes into London.\" There is no planned rail engineering work affecting Leeds, which is expected to see thousands of people travelling to the Leeds Festival at Bramham Park over the bank holiday weekend.", "question": "It is the last bank holiday of the summer and millions of cars will be on the roads .

{"article": "George Boole, who was born in Lincoln in 1815, invented Boolean logic, a system of AND, OR or NOT statements. It is still used in games, apps and search engines, including Google, which uses plus or minus to narrow results. Those behind the artwork, titled Perhaps, said it was about looking beyond yes and no. Jeanine Griffin, from the university, who was involved in commissioning the work, said: \"This new sculpture pays testament to a truly revolutionary thinker whose ideas continue to transform the way we live 150 years on. \"Boole's legacy is all around us; in every computer, smartphone and digital device.\" The sculpture, comprising interlocking arcs coated in a reflective surface, has been created by Raqs Media Collective. Monica Narula, from the New Delhi-based collective, said: \"Lincoln was George Boole's birthplace. He must have walked by Brayford Pool, asking questions that needed answers in yes, no, and perhaps, perhaps. \"This work remembers those moments outside the boundaries of yes and no...\" The sculpture, which is temporary, will be in place close to the Minerva Building at the University of Lincoln for two months from 8th July. George Boole told a friend in 1851 Boolean logic could be \"the most valuable if not the only valuable contribution that I have made or am likely to make to science and the thing by which I would desire if at all to be remembered hereafter\". The mathematician died on 8 December 1864. He is buried in Ballintemple, Cork, Republic of Ireland, where he spent his final years.

However, he has not won a tour title since 2015 and has struggled for form this year, winning just nine matches overall and losing in the first rounds at the French Open and Wimbledon. When asked what advice he would give to aspiring tennis players, Tomic said: \"Don't play tennis. \"Do something you love and enjoy because it's a grind and it's a tough, tough, tough life.

{"article": "With his dark sunglasses, his gun and his tattoos, he looks every inch the movie stereotype of the maverick American law enforcement officer, but until seven years ago Christian lived in Brechin. He swapped the east coast of Scotland for the eastern seaboard of the US when he was 21. He worked briefly as a bouncer in Washington DC before obtaining a licence as a bail enforcement agent, often referred to as bounty hunters. They are contracted by bondsmen, money lenders who offer to cover bail money for those who can't afford it in exchange for a 10% commission. If the accused fails to show in court the bondsman loses the entire sum unless a bounty hunter can track down the fugitive. In Virginia, like most US states, it is not only police who get to carry guns and chase criminals. Christian says: \"Every boy, every man wants to have the gun and go kicking in doors. \"It's exciting being like that but I prefer being the undercover detective kind of guy.\" He says he is not a typical bounty hunter and has a low opinion of some others who seem to delight in the macho violence of the job. Christian moved to the US seven years ago to track down his American father. He had been getting into a lot of trouble at home and could not get a job. \"Plus I thought Americans always looked a lot cooler in movies so I thought I'd give it a try,\" he says. In the BBC documentary - The Scottish Bounty Hunter - Christian tells how he felt the need to escape his home town because he was taking \"a lot of ecstasy\" during \"week-long parties\". \"There was bugger all else to do,\" he says. \"I feel like in Scotland I was supposed to die there.\" His mother tells the programme she is pleased he left. She says: \"They were getting into trouble with the police and drinking and hanging around with the wrong people. \"Brechin doesn't have anything going for it really. There's not a lot of work in the area. It's like some place to sleep now. \"There's no potential here for young people.\" Christian sees similar problems in Virginia. About 80% of the jobs he gets as a bounty hunter are drugs related. He says he wants to help offenders and their families get back to a normal life but he gets paid for finding and putting people back in jail. He says: \"I can't feel sorry for anyone or I'd just end up taking handcuffs off everybody. \"I've thought about taking them off many times and letting folk go but I can't do that. This is what I signed up for.\" Christian can use lots of different methods to track people down but his first port of call is Facebook, which can give him clues to where people like to go and who they might be with. He says he caught a woman in Maryland because she used Facebook \"check in\". Christian says he knew she was going to a beauty school but didn't know which one. \"She would 'check in' at this coffee shop every single morning,\" he says. \"Every morning she was there at the same time 'Getting coffee on my way to school' - on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. \"On the Thursday - no check in. Because I checked her into Winchester jail.\" As well as getting paid to put people in jail, Christian makes money getting people out. Four years ago he started lending bail money as a bondsman himself. In an average week he'll track down five or six people and bail even more out of jail. He says the job is stressful, dangerous and exhausting. \"Bounty hunters don't last very long,\" he says. \"I only know of three or four who have been in it as long as I have. \"They either can't handle the hours or can't handle the stress.\" But Christian says he keeps doing it because it is a chance to help people turn their life around. He says: \"I've got a lot of relationships with people who might end up going off the rails if I left. \"This is a job you can't do half-arsed. \"You are either going to be a bounty hunter full time or you are not going to be one at all. \"I've tried to get out of it two or three times but I just can't seem to stop doing it.\" The Scottish Bounty Hunter is on BBC One Scotland on Monday 13 February at 22:40.", "question": "Christian Matlock is a bounty hunter who spends his days and nights tracking down fugitives who have @placeholder bail in the US state of Virginia .", "option_0": "obtained", "option_1": "arrived", "option_2": "skipped", "option_3": "poured", "option_4": "joined", "label": 2}
{"article": "Henrhyd Falls in the Brecon Beacons National Park was used as the cover for the Batcave in the film The Dark Knight Rises. Fans previously had to clamber down a steep tree-lined hill and wade across a river to reach the falls. Park chiefs have now built a path to the waterfall for easier access. The 88ft (27m) wall of water was seen in the final film of the Christopher Nolan trilogy as the location where Robin discovers the Batcave after the apparent death of Batman. The new trail and footbridge bring visitors out at the foot of the falls, and they can then walk behind the water and into the entrance of the Batcave. Henrhyd Falls is the tallest waterfall in south Wales and is a site of special scientific interest due to the rare mosses, liverworts and lichen which grow in the damp, heavily wooded gorge, with its thin soils and steep rocky slopes. Batman fan Jackie Davies, 24, from Bridgend, said: \"I love Christian Bale in the Batman films and coming here you can feel like you're a part of that world. \"The waterfall is spectacular and I had to come with my costume for a picture. My boyfriend finds it embarrassing but I love it.\" Judith Harvey, wardens manager for Brecon Beacons National Park Authority, said the falls were a popular walking destination in the Brecon Beacons. \"With work now complete, it means that people for many generations to come can really enjoy what Abercraf and the surrounding area has to offer, safe in the knowledge that they are not causing any damage.\"", "question": "The waterfall used by Batman star Christian Bale to conceal the superhero 's secret @placeholder on screen can now be reached via a woodland trail .", "option_0": "hideout", "option_1": "powers", "option_2": "impact", "option_3": "cave", "option_4": "structure", "label": 3}
{"article": "Images include prisoners taking part in a snowball fight during World War One and a tunnel which may have been dug as part of an escape attempt. The pictures have been shared by the great nephew of Captain Eli Bowers, who was among the camp's guards. They \"add to our understanding of the history of the camp\", said island historian Ian Ronayne. The site at Les Blanches Banques housed nearly 2,000 men from the German armed forces from 1915-1917. Dr Brian K Feltman, from Georgia Southern University in the United States, said the snowball fight showed prisoners \"breaking the monotony of camp life\". He said it could be an example of prisoners staving off \"barbed wire disease\", a form of depression associated with \"the boredom and regulations\" imposed on prisoners of war. Mr Ronayne, a WW1 blogger for Jersey Heritage, said some of the images showed tunnels which may have been used during one of the attempts to escape the camp. He said if the images related to one of these incidents it would be a \"fantastic find\". Another showed two sets of fencing at the camp - \"barbed wire on the inside... and then an electrified fence\" -  which was rare, according to Dr Heather Jones from the International History at the London School of Economics. \"I have not come across an electric fence being used for a UK home front prisoner of war camp before,\" she added. Capt Bowers served in the Royal Jersey Militia and took the six photos from late 1916 to early 1917. Helier Falle found the pictures in his mother's house. \"Rather than leave them sitting in a drawer for nobody to see, I thought they should be shared,\" he said.
